Even if you use the same ICC profile and the same printer, printing on\na different paper can result in a very different color appearance.\nColors can change from paper to paper, particularly if you change from coated to uncoated paper or from sheet-fed to continuous forms paper.\nThe changes can be so noticeable that printer manufacturers generally test and certify papers with certain characteristics for use with their\nprinters. They also create different ICC profiles for their printers based on paper characteristics. Some ICC profiles can be used for groups of\npapers that have similar characteristics.\nWhen you load paper, you set certain paper characteristics on the printer. When the printer chooses the correct device-specific output profile to\nuse, it takes the characteristics into consideration. The paper characteristics are:\nMedia brightness\nThe percentage of light that the paper reflects\nMedia color\nThe color of the paper\nMedia finish\nThe characteristics of the surface of the paper, such as: glossy, satin, matte\nMedia weight\nThe basic weight of the paper\nParent topic: Color Management\n1 of 1"}]}
