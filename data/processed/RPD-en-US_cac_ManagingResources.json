The index is stored as a\nfile in the library that it refers to. You must store CMRs in resource libraries that use a RAT. We recommend that you store data objects in\nresource libraries that use a RAT as well.\nWhen you use AFP Resource Installer to create a resource library, it creates a RAT and stores it in the library. When you install a CMR or data\nobject, AFP Resource Installer updates the RAT with information about the resource. When a print server looks in a resource library for a resource,\nit first looks in the RAT to see if the resource is listed.\nThe print server relies on the RAT; if it is incorrect, the print server cannot find resources in the resource library. As a result, you must always use\nAFP Resource Installer to manage your resource libraries, including to:\nAdd CMRs and data objects to a resource library.\nDo not copy CMRs or data objects directly into the resource libraries that AFP Resource Installer uses. If you copy CMRs or data objects into\nthese resource libraries, the RAT is not updated so the print server cannot use it to find the CMRs or data objects.\nModify properties of data objects and CMRs listed in the RAT.\nDo not directly edit the RAT or any of the files in a resource library. Do not replace an existing version of a CMR or data object with a new\nversion by copying the new version directly into the resource library; use AFP Resource Installer to update the resource.\nInstall CMRs or data objects in a different resource library or replicate a resource library in a different location.\nDo not copy CMRs or data objects from a resource library and store them in another location.\nFor more information about completing these tasks, see the AFP Resource Installer online help.\nParent topic: AFP Color Management\n1 of 1"}]}
