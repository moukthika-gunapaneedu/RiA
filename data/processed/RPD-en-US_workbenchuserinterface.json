It can display:\nBar Code Object Content Architecture (BCOCA) objects: POSTNET barcodes, Intelligent Mail barcodes (IMBs), Interleaved 2of5, Code39, and QR\nCode\nGraphics Object Content Architecture (GOCA) objects\nIM1 and Image Object Content Architecture (IOCA) images\nIndex tags (also called Tag Logical Elements or TLEs)\nJoint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) images\nMedium map information in a form definition, including overlay, page, and sheet information\nOverlays\nPage segments\nText, including outline fonts, double-byte character set (DBCS) fonts, and text barcodes (text barcodes use barcode fonts)\nThe user interface cannot display all AFP objects, and it might not display some text and AFP objects with complete fidelity. These are the\nlimitations:\nBCOCA objects: The user interface can only display POSTNET, IMB, Interleaved 2of5, Code39, and QR Code BCOCA objects. For other types of\nBCOCA objects, it displays a box the size of the barcode area. It cannot display any human-readable interpretation (HRI) text.\nForm definitions: The user interface does not apply any modifications in the form definition (such as print direction, page position, constant\nback, and N_UP page positioning).\nImages: Images might differ from printed images because of color differences and resolution differences between monitors and printers.\nText: The user interface cannot display user-defined characters in DBCS fonts.\nNote:\nThe user interface can display AFP files that the RICOH ProcessDirector transform features transformed to AFP format (for example, from\nPDF to AFP). You can also enhance these AFP files.\nThe user interface has several modes. The modes that are available depend on the components that are installed. Each mode lets you make\ndifferent enhancements. The AFP Indexer mode lets you create page groups and index tags. The AFP Editor mode lets you create barcodes, text,\nand hidden areas. Whitespace Manager lets you create definitions for white space and fill the white space with content. The Document Property\nDesigner mode lets you customize document properties.\nThis diagram shows the major parts of the user interface. It shows the title bar, menu bar, toolbar, AFP file, file-structure pane, index pane, and\nstatus bar.\n1 of 5"}, {"page": 2, "text": "2/4/26, 2:24 PM User interface - Jenski - Test portal- RPD Linux\n1.

Below the menu bar is the toolbar, which contains icons for the most common functions available on the\nmenu bar. The options on the menu bar and toolbar vary depending on whether an AFP file is open. If an AFP file is not open, you see only the\nFile and Help options.

If another AFP file is already open, it is automatically closed. If you have not saved the\ncontrol file for the AFP file that is already open, RICOH Visual Workbench lets you save the control file before it opens the new AFP file.\nOpen Control File\nOpens an existing control file that you created previously.\nReset\nCloses the current AFP file and clears cached resources from memory.\nSave Control File (Ctrl+S)\nSaves the control file for the open AFP file. A control file with the same name is overwritten.\nSave Control File As\nSaves the control file for the open AFP file. You can specify a name and directory for the control file.\nExit\n2 of 5"}, {"page": 3, "text": "2/4/26, 2:24 PM User interface - Jenski - Test portal- RPD Linux\nStops RICOH Visual Workbench.
