If the AFP Support feature is installed,\nAFP print jobs can also include banner pages between copies of a multi-copy job. Banner pages usually include identifying information about the\njobs, such as the job ID, file name, and the time the job was submitted.\nIn this section:\nIdentifying properties for banner pages\nUpdate the banner_page_property_values.cfg configuration file to define the properties that you can include on banner pages. The\nconfiguration file defines the elements that can print on banner pages, including properties of jobs, orders, printers, load plans, and other\nobjects, system settings, and text strings.\nAFP banner pages\nAFP banner pages include header, trailer, and separator pages. They can be used (in any combination) with AFP print jobs printed to AFP printer\nobjects. You can change the contents and appearance of those banner pages, as well as the fonts used to print them.\nPDF banner pages\nPDF header pages and trailer pages can be used with PDF jobs. They can also be used with jobs in other data streams, but only if the printer they\nare sent to supports printing PDF files. You can change the contents and appearance of PDF banner pages, and the fonts used to print them.\nParent topic: Configuring\n1 of 1"}]}
