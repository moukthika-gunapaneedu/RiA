Examples are the Receive, Prepare, Print, and Complete\nphases. A job checkpoint always occurs at the end of a phase.\nIn general, a service policy defines job checkpoints for at least two phases: a checkpoint for the final phase and one or more checkpoints for\nintermediate phases. Checkpoints for intermediate phases let you find jobs that are late before they miss the checkpoint for the final phase.\nFor example, a service policy could define a checkpoint at the end of the Prepare phase and a checkpoint at the end of the Print phase. If an\nerror (for example, a transform error) occurs during the Prepare phase, RICOH ProcessDirector marks the job Late when it misses the Prepare\ncheckpoint. A yellow dot appears in the Deadlines portlet and in the Schedule risk column for the job in the Jobs table. If the operator can\ncorrect the error, the job could complete printing on time. If the job completes the Print phase before the Print checkpoint, the checkpoint status\nchanges back to OK. The yellow dot is removed.\nA service policy does not need to define a job checkpoint for each phase. A service policy might not define a checkpoint for these types of\nphases:\nPhases that do not contain any steps (for example, the Prepare phase).\nPhases where errors are not likely to occur (for example, the Receive phase).\nPhases that occur after jobs have met the performance objective (for example, the Complete phase).\nParent topic: Service policies\n1 of 1"}]}
