No-service periods work\ntogether with service policies but are not considered for deadlines set by the SetDeadline step or the Change Deadline action.\nEach service policy specifies whether all the no-service periods apply to the service policy. If they apply, RICOH ProcessDirector adjusts the\nplanned checkpoints of jobs so that they do not occur during the no-service periods.\nFor example, a service policy for “express” print jobs might specify not to adjust planned checkpoints for the no-service periods because the\ninstallation provides services every day for “express” print jobs. However, the service policy for “regular” jobs might specify to adjust planned\ncheckpoints for the no-service periods.\nAll the no-service periods work together as one unit. A service policy can specify whether all the no-service periods apply to the policy. However,\na service policy cannot specify which no-service periods apply.\nExamples of no-service periods are:\nEvery January 1\nAugust 1, 2008\nEvery Friday from 18:00 to 23:59\nEvery Sunday, all day\nIf you delete a no-service period, checkpoint times for jobs that are already in the system do not change, even if they were set using that no-\nservice period. To reset the checkpoint times, you must reprocess the job from the beginning.\nParent topic: System objects\n1 of 1"}]}
