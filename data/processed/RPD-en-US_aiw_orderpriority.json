You can use the Set Priority action to\ncontrol how quickly the jobs move through their workflows.\nJob priority is a numerical value from 1 through 999. RICOH ProcessDirector processes jobs with a priority of 1 through each of their steps before\nother jobs with lower priorities that are queued to the steps. For example, RICOH ProcessDirector processes jobs with a priority of 50 through the\nsteps at a later time, and processes jobs with a priority of 99 at an even later time.\nNote:\nJobs that contain a JDF file must use a job priority value between 1 and 100. If you enter a value that exceeds 100, RICOH\nProcessDirector reverts the value to 100.\nTo set the priority for orders:\n1. In the Orders table, select the order or orders that you want to process sooner.\n2. Click Set Priority.\nThe Set Priority dialog shows the order or orders you selected plus all the order information.\n3. For each order, click its row under the Order priority column and enter a new value to set the priority.\n4. Click OK to save the settings and return to the Main page.\nNote:\nWhen you change the priority of an order, all the jobs included in the order are updated with the same priority value.\nYou can update priority for each job individually. If you change the priority for the entire order, the job priority is updated with the same\npriority as the order.\nParent topic: Orders\n1 of 1"}]}
