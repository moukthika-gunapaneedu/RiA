You also must configure the workflows\nthat the jobs are assigned to. Printers defined as Ricoh PDF or TASKalfa printers can manage PDF jobs with JDF tickets better than printers\ndefined as Passthrough or Custom PDF printers can.\nIf you have Kodak printers that accept PDF, you can send some JDF information to the printer in the KDK data stream recommended by the\nmanufacturer. The Cut Sheet Support for Kodak feature is required.\nIf you have Xerox printers that accept PDF, you can send some JDF information in the XPIF or XRX data streams recommended by the\nmanufacturer. The Cut Sheet Support for Xerox feature is required.\nBefore you begin this procedure, review the supplied workflows to see if any of them contain some or all the steps that you want to include. If\nyou find a good workflow, you can copy it and modify it to meet your needs. The workflow must contain a step based on the\nSetJobPropsFromTextFile step template.\nNote:\nThis step template can use an optional jobID.overrides.jdf file to set more properties on the job.\nIn addition, determine whether you can use a hot folder input device that RICOH ProcessDirector provides or whether the installation requires a\ncustomized input device. RICOH ProcessDirector provides several hot folder input devices that you can use with only minor modifications or that\nyou can copy to create a customized hot folder input device.\nFinally, decide which batching method you want to use. The JDF, List, and Pattern batching methods are all suitable for jobs with JDF job tickets.\nTo configure to use JDF job tickets:\n1. Copy and modify a workflow that contains the processing steps that you want the jobs that are submitted with JDF job tickets to follow:\n1. Click the Workflow tab.\n2. Right-click the workflow that you want to copy and select Copy.\n3. Name the copy of the workflow, fill in or edit other values that you need, and click Continue.\n4. Right-click each step and select Properties. Modify the properties as necessary.\n5. Save and enable the workflow by changing , the Save & Enable/Disable switch, to the On position.\n6. Repeat these steps if you want to create more workflows.\n2. On the RICOH ProcessDirector system, configure an input device so that it assigns the correct workflow for JDF job tickets. We recommend\nthat you copy and rename the supplied HotFolderJDF input device, then verify or update the settings described in the following steps.\n1. Click the Administration tab.\n2. In the left pane, click Devices ⇒ Input Devices.\n3. Right-click the HotFolderJDF input device and select Copy.\n4. In the left pane, click Show all to display all the properties for this input device.\n5. Verify or update the values for these properties:\nWorkflow\nParentNoPrint\nChild workflow\nThe workflow that is appropriate for the data files in the job.\nNote:\nIf you use the List batching method, select a workflow that includes a step based on the WaitForGroup step template\nbefore the PrintJobs step. These steps ensure that the jobs print in order.\nIf you use overrides files, select a workflow that includes a step based on the SetJobPropsFromTextFile step template.\nData patterns\nOne or more pattern-matching strings. The strings define the characters in the name of the data file to match with the names of\nother files that arrive in the hot folder. If you specify more than one data pattern, the file is considered a match if it matches any\npattern. The data pattern is a regular expression.\n1 of 3"}, {"page": 2, "text": "2/4/26, 2:11 PM Configuring to use JDF job tickets - Jenski - Test portal- RPD Linux\nIf the value of the Create .zip file property is Yes, only files that match the data pattern are included in the .zip file.\nSubmit step\nSubmitInputFiles\n6.

Make sure that the new input device is connected and enabled.\n4. Submit jobs to the new input device. If errors occur, correct the errors that messages from RICOH ProcessDirector or any application that it\ncalls identify.\nIn this section:\n2 of 3"}, {"page": 3, "text": "2/4/26, 2:11 PM Configuring to use JDF job tickets - Jenski - Test portal- RPD Linux\nLocating files\nApplications that submit jobs with JDF job tickets can either send the files along with the job ticket, or leave the files in another location on the\nnetwork. The job ticket is not required to list the files that the job contains. However, if the job ticket does list the files, it can use either relative\npath names or absolute path names.\nUsing a mapping file to find input files\nIf you use a Job Definition Format (JDF) job ticket to submit jobs to a Hot folder device, you do not have to copy all the input files to the Hot\nfolder. When the job ticket is placed in the Hot folder, RICOH ProcessDirector reads it and searches for the input files that it lists.\nSetting job properties from the JDF job ticket\nRICOH ProcessDirector can use the values that it supports in the JDF job ticket to set job properties.\nParent topic: Preparing for job submission\n3 of 3"}]}
