Log in to the computer as the RICOH ProcessDirector system user (aiw1 is the default), or with a user ID that is a member of the RICOH\nProcessDirector group (aiwgrp1 is the default).\nYou can also log in as the root user.\n2. Navigate to the /aiw/aiw1/lib/AVE/resources directory.\n3. Open the sample font-mapping files in a file editor, edit them, and save them.\nAll font-mapping files that you want to use must be in the same directory.\n4. If you edited sample file SampleCodePointMap.cp, rename it to the name of the AFP code page.\nFor example, if the name of the code page is T1000259, name the file T1000259.cp.\nParent topic: Mapping fonts for AFP files\n1 of 1"}]}
