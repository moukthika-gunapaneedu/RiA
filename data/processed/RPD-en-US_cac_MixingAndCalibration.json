A printer mixes colors by\nprinting four layers of a page or an image, one in each color. If the printer registration is not set correctly, the images do not line up properly and\nthe colors appear wrong. In addition, the printer must be calibrated to ensure that all its systems are functioning correctly and that it is in a\nknown good state.\nBy using the color information described in its color space, each device determines the amount of cyan, magenta, yellow, or black to use. Dots of\neach color are printed in overlapping patterns that, when interpreted by your eyes, blend the colors appropriately. To ensure the colors are\ncreated accurately, the color planes must be perfectly aligned. If they are not, you might see moire patterns, unintended patterns in the printed\nimages, or poorly blended colors, which are especially noticeable on the edges of your images.\nColor printers must be calibrated regularly, in some cases daily, to ensure that the colors they produce are consistent. In addition, follow the\nrecommended printhead maintenance procedures and schedule to ensure that the printer operates optimally. Even when a printer is calibrated\ncorrectly, its gamut is much smaller than that of any monitor, so images do not look the same when they are printed as they do when they are\ndisplayed on a monitor.\nParent topic: Color Printing Concepts\n1 of 1"}]}
