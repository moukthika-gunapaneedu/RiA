The step names the Visual Workbench control file that contains the\ndefinitions for the white space.\nYou can base the step on the FillWhiteSpace step template. When you configure the step and AFP Indexer, AFP Editor, or both are installed, you\ncan choose to first create any page groups, index tags, barcodes, hidden areas, and text that are defined in the same control file before filling the\nwhite space areas. The white space areas are often dependent on the page groups, index tags, and other items being created first.\nPosition the step relative to these steps if they are present:\nAfter a step that converts line data to AFP format (for example, after the ConvertLineDataJobIntoAFP step).\nAfter a step that converts Xerox data to AFP format.\nBefore a step that transforms AFP files into another format (for example, before the TransformJobIntoPDF step).\nBefore the EnableRepositioning step if you configure the FillWhiteSpace step to create page groups and index tags, text, or both.\nBefore the PrintJobs step.\nAfter a step based on the IndexAFP or EditAFP step template (unless using Index first or Edit first).\nNote:\nIf you created fixed-length page groups with the IndexAFP step template, you can use the FillWhiteSpace step template to fill white space\nwith content in AFP files that the RICOH ProcessDirectorTransform Features create.\nTo add a step to fill white space with content in AFP files:\n1. Click the Workflow tab.\n2. Click the name of the workflow you want to modify.\nIf you prefer to modify a copy of the workflow, right click it and choose Copy. Name the copy of the workflow, fill in or edit other values\nthat you need, and click Continue.\n3. Optional: Disable the workflow by clicking the switch to the left of the workflow name. If you do not disable the workflow while you edit\nit, jobs that use this workflow continue to move through steps. When you save, the workflow is momentarily disabled then enabled again.\nJobs that are processing in the workflow could move into error.\n4. In the workflow editor, click Step Templates in the top right corner of the window.\n5. Select the FillWhiteSpace step template and drag it into the workflow editor. Place the step where you want it.\n6. Connect the FillWhiteSpace step to other steps.\n7. Right-click the step and select Properties.\n8. If necessary, change the General properties.\n9. Click AFP.\n10. In the Visual Workbench control file field, type the path and file name of the Visual Workbench control file that contains the white space\ndefinitions.\nNote:\nIf you want to use the workflow for input files that require different control files, you can use symbolic notation for the name of the\ncontrol file. For example, if you have two input files, abc.afp and xyz, with corresponding control files, abc.afp.ctl and\nxyz.ctl, and you want to use the same workflow for both files, you can use ${Job.InputFile}.ctl as the control file in the\nVisual Workbench control file field. ${Job.InputFile}.ctl causes RICOH ProcessDirector to set the value of the Visual\nWorkbench control file to the name of the input file plus the .ctl extension.\n11. If the control file contains definitions to create page groups and index tags, you might want to select Yes in the Index first field.\nNote:\nDo not select Index first if the IndexAFP step and the FillWhiteSpace step run in different phases. For example, you might need to\nput the IndexAFP step in the Prepare phase and the FillWhiteSpace step in the Assemble phase after the EditAFP step (or select Edit\nfirst).\n1 of 2"}, {"page": 2, "text": "2/4/26, 2:10 PM Adding steps to fill white space in AFP files - Jenski - Test portal- RPD Linux\nIf you select Yes in the Index first field, remove any step from the workflow that is based on the IndexAFP step template because\nthe Index first option and the IndexAFP step provide the same function. (It is more efficient to select Yes in the Index first field than\nto run an IndexAFP step.)\n12. If the control file contains definitions to create barcodes, hidden areas, or text, you might want to select Yes in the Edit first field.\nNote:\nThe Edit first field applies only if AFP Editor is installed.
