InfoPrint 4100 printers with the InfoPrint POWER architecture and microcode release\n15.4 or later support the AFP color management architecture and can be used to print very high-quality grayscale images.\nThe base level of AFP color management support in InfoPrint 4100 printers with the InfoPrint POWER architecture and microcode release 15.4 or\nlater lets you apply color management to grayscale text, graphics (GOCA), bi-level images (IOCA FS10), and barcodes. To use color management\nfunctions with other types of objects, the AFP Color Emulation feature is required.\nThe AFP Color Emulation feature lets you print color objects in grayscale. When the feature is installed, AFP Color Management lets you natively\nprint GIF, IOCA FS11, IOCA FS45, JPEG, and TIFF images in high-quality grayscale.\nNote:\nSingle-page PDF and EPS data objects are not supported on the InfoPrint 4100.\nInfoPrint 4100 printers support these types of CMRs:\nColor conversion\nLink color conversion\nTone transfer curve\nHalftone\nFor even better images on InfoPrint 4100 Models MS1, MD1, and MD2, you can also install the Image Enhancement feature. Benefits of this\nfeature include:\nEnhanced fusing technology to minimize toner distortion\nOptimized developer unit for high coverage and high-density applications\nImproved halftones tailored to new hardware and toner technology\nParent topic: Printers\n1 of 1"}]}
