RICOH ProcessDirector\nsupports both API key and session authentication. Input device objects authenticate when they poll for input. Notification objects authenticate\nwhen they send status to the application.\nFor API key authentication, you put an authorization code in a Static credential property or define an HTTP user ID and password. The\nauthorization code or the HTTP user ID and password is sent to the web service that exchanges data. The web service then authenticates with\nthe application and returns a response.\nFor session authentication, you put authentication credentials (user ID and password) and other values in a set of authentication request\nproperties. The input device or notification first calls a SOAP web service to authenticate with the application. After a successful authentication,\nthe web service returns a token to the input device or notification. The token is transmitted in the call to the web service that exchanges data.\nIf the application allows one session per user, set up your objects to call the web services with different user IDs and passwords.\nSession authentication occurs with every web service call and logging out is not required. Make sure that the length of the session for each set\nof credentials is shorter than the time between calls to the web service. For example, the session for an input device expires after 10 minutes.\nWhen you configure the input device, specify a polling interval greater than 10 minutes.\nTo get an API key or authentication credentials for an application, contact the company that hosts the application. For format and syntax\nrequirements, refer to the documentation of the application.\nTo use a SOAP web service to authenticate:\n1. Click the Authentication tab on the SOAP web service input device or notification.\n2. Follow the instructions for the type of authentication that the application requires:\nFor API key authentication, specify the authentication code as the value of the Static credential property.\nLeave all the other properties blank. You have completed this procedure.\nFor session authentication, leave the Static credential property blank. Go to the next step and specify the other properties.\n3. Set the Authentication request URL property to the URL that RICOH ProcessDirector uses to authenticate with the application.\nIf the application requires authentication credentials in the URL, specify them using the required format and syntax.\n4. For the value of the Authentication request payload property, specify the body of the web services request that the input device or\nnotification submits to the application for authentication.\nIn these examples, the payload includes three elements: <Credentials>, <Name>, and <Password>. The value of the <Password>\nelement is a symbol that uses the Authentication request password property.\nThis example uses the Authentication request password property for input devices:\n<Credentials> <Name>myname</Name> <Password>${WebService.AuthRequestPwd}</Password></Credentials>\nThis example uses the Authentication request password property for notifications:\n<Credentials> <Name>myname</Name> <Password>${WSNotification.WebService.AuthRequestPwd}</Password>\n</Credentials>\nThe symbol is resolved when the authentication request is sent.\n5. Set the Authentication SOAP request property to the SOAP request that RICOH ProcessDirector created when you imported the WSDL file.\nFor example, you want to use the AuthenticateUser SOAP request. You prepended PrintShop to the names of the SOAP requests when you\nimported them. Select PrintShop-AuthenticateUser.\n6. Set the Authentication response attribute property to the XPath expression that identifies the credential for the session in the response\nfrom the web service.\n7. Set the Authentication request password property to the password for your account with the application.\nThe password is encrypted when it is stored in RICOH ProcessDirector.\nFor both API key and session authentication, RICOH ProcessDirector stores the static credential or token returned from the application in a\nproperty.\nFor input devices, the property is WebService.Credential.\nFor notifications, the property is WSNotification.WebService.Credential.\nWhen you specify values on the Request tab for a SOAP web service input device or notification, you specify the WebService.Credential or\nWSNotification.WebService.Credential property as a symbol.\nRICOH ProcessDirector substitutes the value of the static credential or token for the symbol when it transmits the request to the web service.\n1 of 2"}, {"page": 2, "text": "2/4/26, 2:19 PM Using a SOAP web service to authenticate with an application - Jenski - Test portal- RPD Linux\nNow that you have specified the values required to authenticate with the application, complete the steps for defining and configuring the input\ndevice or notification.
