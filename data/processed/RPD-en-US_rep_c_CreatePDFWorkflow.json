You\ncan also add StoreInRepository steps to your existing workflows. If you want the repository to hold documents and document data, make sure to\nadd the necessary document processing steps if they are not already present.\nBefore you create a workflow, plan for retention of files and documents, create repositories, and make enhancements to PDF files.\nTo create a workflow to store PDF jobs and documents in a repository:\n1. Click the Workflow tab.\n2. Right-click the RepositorySample workflow and select Copy.\n3. Name the copy of the workflow, fill in or edit other values that you need, and click Continue.\n4. Right-click the IdentifyPDFDocuments step. Select Properties, and then click PDF. For the Identify PDF control file property, type the path\nand file name of the control file that contains your document property definitions. Click OK.\n5. Right-click the BuildPDFFromDocuments step. Select Properties, and then click PDF. For the Build PDF control file 1 property, type the path\nand file name of the control file that contains your document property definitions. Click OK.\n6. Optional: Right-click the RetainCompletedJobs step. Select Properties, and then click Job Defaults - General. Update the value of the\nRetention period property. Click OK.\n7. Right-click the StoreInRepository step, select Properties, and then click Repository:\n1. For the Repository property, select the repository that you want to store jobs and documents in.\n2. From the Available job properties to store list, select the job properties that you want to use to search for jobs and documents in the\nrepository.\n3. From the Available document properties to store list, select the document properties that you want to use to search for documents in\nthe repository.\n4. If you want to preserve the values of job properties for use when the job or its documents are resubmitted to a workflow:\n1. Use a text editor to create an override properties file.\n2. Place the database name of each job property on a separate line.\n3. To add a comment, place it on a separate line that starts with a pound sign (#).\nThis example shows a file with three job properties (Customer name, Media required, and Duplex) and a comment:\nJob.CustomerNameJob.MediaRequired# This is a comment.Job.Duplex\n4. Name the file, save it, and move it to a directory on the RICOH ProcessDirector primary computer. For example:\n/aiw/aiw1/control_files/job_properties.txt (Linux)\nC:\\aiw\\aiw1\\control_files\\job_properties.txt (Windows)\n5. On the StoreInRepository step, enter the path and name of the file in the Path to override properties file property.\n5. If you are using an associated properties file, enter the path and name of the file in the Associated properties file property.\n6. If you want to store document data that is contained in a file but is not defined as a document property to RICOH ProcessDirector,\nenter the full path and name or the symbolic name of the file in the Document properties file property and make sure to select ALL in\nthe Document properties to store list.\n7. Click OK.\nNote:\nMake sure that the StoreInRepository step is in the correct place in the workflow. Storing a file after steps that change the order of\npages, such as ReversePDFPageOrder, affects your ability to search using document properties in the viewer.\n8. Optional: If you want to store job files in the repository more than once, include additional StoreInRepository steps in the workflow.\n9. Save and enable the workflow.\n10. To test the workflow:\n1. Create one or more input devices to point to the workflow.\n2. Enable the input devices.\n3. Submit your PDF print job to the input device.\n4. When the job finishes, look in the Archive to make sure that the right information was stored.\n1 of 2"}, {"page": 2, "text": "2/4/26, 2:18 PM Creating a workflow to store PDF jobs and documents in a repository - Jenski - Test portal- RPD Linux\nNote:\nIf a job is processed again and runs the StoreInRepository step more than once, two copies of the document or job are stored in the\nrepository.\nParent topic: Workflows that store jobs and data in a repository\n2 of 2"}]}
