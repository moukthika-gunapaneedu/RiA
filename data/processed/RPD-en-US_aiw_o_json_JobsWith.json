You can submit JSON files to an input device or place a JSON file at a location\nfrom which the RICOH ProcessDirector server retrieves it. You can use REST web service input device to retrieve JSON files that become jobs.\nIf you place a JSON file at a location from which it is retrieved, RICOH ProcessDirector processes the file as jobs move through the workflow. You\nsubmit another type of file to the hot folder to initiate the process. For example, you can submit a print file or a trigger file, such as a file with job\noverrides or with no content.\nNote: The Web Services Enablement feature lets you use REST web service protocols to receive JSON data from and exchange it with other\napplications.\nA step based on the ConvertJSONToXML step template converts a JSON input file to an XML output file. You can then use RICOH ProcessDirector\nstep templates that manipulate XML files.\nParent topic: Product overview\n1 of 1"}]}
