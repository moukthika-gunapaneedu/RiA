You can make minor modifications to the properties of any of these input devices and use\nthem in the installation. You can also copy them to create new input devices.\nNote: If you plan to create Download input devices and you want to receive messages from the Download daemon in a language that is\ndifferent from the language that you chose when you installed the RICOH ProcessDirector server, set the Device language property of the\ninput device to the appropriate language.\nIn this section:\nUsing supplied input devices\nRICOH ProcessDirector provides several predefined input devices. If your print environment is simple and does not require many input devices,\nyou can modify the properties of the predefined input devices and use them in your environment.\nCopying input devices\nYou can copy an input device so you can use it as a template for creating another input device. Copying input devices can save you time,\nespecially when you need to create several input devices with similar properties.\nCreating input devices\nWhen you need an input device that has very different properties from existing input devices, you can create a new one.\nSetting up hot folder input devices to process batch jobs\nTo set up a hot folder input device to process batch jobs, you must configure it to use the appropriate batching method and to recognize the\ninput files.\nDefining input devices for use with transform features\nYou can define a Hot folder input device that you can use to receive input files that need to be sent to the RICOH Transform features or to the\nAdvanced Transform feature for conversion into a different data stream.\nParent topic: Configuring\n1 of 1"}]}
