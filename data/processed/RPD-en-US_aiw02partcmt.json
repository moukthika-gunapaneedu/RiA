The base part identifies the color mapping table\nwith a type of reset or normal.\nThe simplest possible color mapping table is a reset color mapping table, which tells the printer not to do any transformations on the color\ninformation found in the document. A reset color mapping table does not have any source or target groups; all other color mapping tables have\nat least one source and one target group.\nIn this section:\nUsing source groups\nEach source group has an identification (ID) number from 1 through 127, which is used to match the source group with a corresponding target\ngroup.\nUsing target groups\nEach target group has an identification (ID) number from 1 through 127, which is used to match the target group with one or more\ncorresponding source groups.\nParent topic: Color mapping table source and output files\n1 of 1"}]}
