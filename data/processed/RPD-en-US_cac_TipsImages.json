If you\nmust scan an image, use an image editing tool to clean up the background as much as possible.\nSave all images in the same standard color space so you only need one input profile for all of them.\nAdobe RGB (1998) is the recommended color space for images that are to be printed.\nFlatten multi-layer images (such as the ones you can create in graphics tools like Adobe Illustrator and Corel Paint Shop Pro) before including\nthem in print jobs.\nUnflattened images are extremely large and more difficult to work with. Save a copy of the original image for future editing, but flatten the\nversion that you include in your print job.\nParent topic: Tips and Best Practices\n1 of 1"}]}
