If the Batching method is set to a value such as Time or\nNumber of pages, use this procedure to submit files as a job before the requirements for batching are met.\nFor example, an input device usually waits to receive 1000 PDF pages before it submits a job. At the end of the day, there are only 650 PDF\npages in the input device. You want to start processing those pages before you leave, so you use this procedure to submit those pages manually.\nNote:\nYou can submit all the input files in an input device with the Batch all action on the input device as long as the Batching method is not\nJDF or Pattern. The Batch all action does not wait for the Polling interval to be reached before creating the jobs.\nTo manually submit a group of input files:\n1. In the Input Devices portlet, right-click the input device whose input files you want to batch together and select Show Files.\nYou see a list of all input files for the selected input device.\n2. Select two or more files whose status is not Error.\nIf the Batching method is Number of sets, Pages in sets, or Sets by time, select all the files for each set.\n3. Click Make Batch.\n4. Click OK.\n5. Click CLOSE.\nThe files are submitted to a workflow based on the batching settings for the input device. If the Batching method is Number of sets, Pages in\nsets, or Sets by time, only complete sets are submitted. The completed sets are combined and submitted as a single job.\nIf the Create .zip file property is set to No, a child job is created for each input file you selected. A parent job is submitted to keep the child jobs\ntogether as a group. If the Create .zip file property is set to Yes, the files are combined in a ZIP file and submitted as a group.\nOther topics in this section:\nBatching all input files\nDisplaying submitted input files\nManually assigning a workflow to an input file\nDeleting input files\nParent topic: Input files\n1 of 1"}]}
