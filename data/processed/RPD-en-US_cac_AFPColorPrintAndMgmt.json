However, to implement an AFP color printing solution with\nfull color management, you must use color management resources (CMRs). We also recommend that you install all your color images as data\nobjects and associate CMRs with them.\nIn this section:\nColor Management Resources\nColor management resources (CMRs) are the foundation of color management in AFP print systems. They are AFP resources that provide all the\ncolor management information, such as ICC profiles and halftones, that an AFP system needs to process a print job and maintain consistent color\nfrom one device to another.\nData Objects\nPresentation data objects contain a single type of data (such as GIF, JPEG, and TIFF images) and can be used in your print jobs. These data objects\ncan be placed directly in a page or overlay or can be defined as resources and included in pages or overlays. Using a data object as a resource is\nmore efficient when that object appears more than once in a print job; resources are downloaded to the printer just once and referenced as\nneeded.\nResource Library Management\nIf you store CMRs and data objects in central resource libraries, you must understand some of the characteristics of resource libraries to make\nsure that your resources are available when and where you need them.\nTips and Best Practices\nThese general guidelines about creating and managing images and other color resources can improve the performance of your AFP color printing\nsystem.\nParent topic: Color and Grayscale Printing\n1 of 1"}]}
