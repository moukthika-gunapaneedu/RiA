This lets you print and view an\nexact version of a document at any time.\nThe transform uses a page definition when it composes the data. Page definitions specify various characteristics of the page, including:\nThe printable area of the page\nThe maximum number of lines that can print on a page\nThe beginning print position on the page\nThe printing direction: across, up, or down the page\nThe page presentation: portrait or landscape\nThe fonts used to print each line of the page\nYou can use one of the page definitions that RICOH ProcessDirector provides or you can provide your own.\nIn this section:\nConfiguring line data transform steps\nYou can incorporate the line data transform into a workflow by adding a ConvertLineDataJobIntoAFP step, then configuring it appropriately.\nThese workflows include the ConvertLineDataJobIntoAFP step: LineData and DownloadLineData.\nConfiguring to use inline resources with line data jobs\nIf you submit line data jobs with inline resources to a workflow that uses the ConvertLineDataJobIntoAFP step, most inline resources are ignored.\nTo recognize and use other inline resources, you must update the ConvertLineDataJobIntoAFP step.\nParent topic: Setting up datastream transforms\n1 of 1"}]}
