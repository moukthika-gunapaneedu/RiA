When used as part of a full AFP color management system, the InfoPrint\n5000 can receive color conversion, link, and tone transfer curve CMRs and apply them to print jobs. Because the printer engine applies its own\nhalftones, it does not support halftone CMRs.\nThe InfoPrint 5000 can capture resources and store them in a repository in its controller so they can be reused in other print jobs. The printer only\ncaptures resources that are marked non-private and capturable using an application such as AFP Resource Installer.\nYou can also submit PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF) jobs to hot folders on the InfoPrint 5000, but those print jobs are not\nprocessed using AFP color management.\nParent topic: Printers\n1 of 1"}]}
