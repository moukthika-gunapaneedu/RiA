The AFP structures add information that your color management system can use, but it leaves the ICC profile unaltered.\nYou can use color conversion CMRs to produce consistent colors on different devices. In a color system, they help ensure that the colors on your\nmonitor are as close as possible to those that are printed. If you move the print job to a different printer, the colors are adjusted again to match\nthe new printer.\nIn a grayscale system, color conversion CMRs map colors to appropriate shades of gray to produce high-quality black and white images.\nPassthrough CMRs are color conversion CMRs that indicate that no color processing should be done if the color space of the presentation device\nis the same as the color space of the CMR. Passthrough CMRs contain no data.\nParent topic: Types of CMRs\n1 of 1"}]}
