The colors printed by one printer\nmight not match the colors printed on another printer, even if they came from the same source. If it is important that colors stay consistent from\ncamera, scanner, or monitor to printer, you must use color management practices.\nIt is virtually impossible to accurately reproduce the colors that you see on your monitor on a printed page. Because printers typically have smaller\ncolor gamuts than other devices, some of the colors must always be adjusted when images are transformed for printing. With color\nmanagement, you can control the adjustments so they are less noticeable than they might be if you use the default settings of your image\ncreation software, print server, and printer.\nSeveral factors play significant roles in color management, including ICC profiles, rendering intents, and paper characteristics.\nIn this section:\nICC Profiles\nThe International Color Consortium (ICC) is an organization that has established open standards for color management. These standards help\nproducts work together by identifying a device-independent color space and defining the elements of an ICC profile.\nRendering Intents\nRendering intents indicate what you want a printer to do with colors that are outside its gamut.\nPaper Characteristics\nThe paper that you use has a significant impact on the colors that you see. Even if you use the same ICC profile and the same printer, printing on\na different paper can result in a very different color appearance.\nParent topic: Color and Grayscale Printing\n1 of 1"}]}
