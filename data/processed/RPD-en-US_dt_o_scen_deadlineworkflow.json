You\nwant to set one deadline for the external program and another deadline for printing the job. You place two SetDeadline steps in the workflow.\nThe first SetDeadline step tracks the time required to complete the RunExternalProgram step. The second SetDeadline step tracks the time to\nprint each job after it completes the RunExternalProgram step.\nLinear PDF workflow\nSetJobPropsFromTextFile\nDetectInputDataStream\nCountPages\nSetDeadline: makes RunExternalProgram the deadline step; sets 30 minutes for the deadline time (Deadline date = Relative to property\nvalue; Property = Current time; Plus or minus = 30 minutes).\nRunExternalProgram: runs a program for the accounting department.\nSetDeadline: makes PrintJobs the deadline step; sets 15 minutes for the deadline time (Deadline date = Relative to property value;\nProperty = Current time; Plus or minus = 15 minutes).\nPrintSetup: lets the operator verify that the requested paper is loaded in the trays.\nCreatePageRanges\nPrintJobs\nRetainCompletedJobs\nRemoveJobs\nWith this workflow, you can see whether a job meets or misses each of its deadlines. If a job misses its first deadline, RICOH ProcessDirector adds\na red dot to the Deadlines portlet and to the Schedule risk column for the job in the Jobs table. If the job then meets its second deadline, the red\ndot is removed.\nParent topic: Usage scenarios for Deadline Tracker\n1 of 1"}]}
