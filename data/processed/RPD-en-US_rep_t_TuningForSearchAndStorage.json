The search function then uses one thread per CPU, so that results are returned more quickly.\nIf you store 10 million or more documents or jobs in the repository, set the max_merge_size to 4000000.\nIf you store fewer than 10 million documents or jobs, set max_merge_size to about 25% of your total documents or jobs stored. For example, if\nyou store 1,000,000 documents, set the max_merge_size to 250000.\nTo tune the repository search:\n1. Navigate to the repository.cfg file in /aiw/aiw1/config/ (Unix-based systems) or C:\\aiw\\aiw1\\config\\ (Windows).\n2. Open repository.cfg in a text editor.\n3. Modify threads_for_search and max_merge_size as needed.\n4. Save the file.\nNote: You do not need to restart RICOH ProcessDirector for the change to take effect.\nParent topic: Setting up the Archive feature\n1 of 1"}]}
