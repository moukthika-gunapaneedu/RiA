Property values\nfor media height, width, weight, and recycled content are considered an exact match if they are within specified tolerances. If the values do not\nmatch any existing objects, RICOH ProcessDirector adds a new media object with those values. If you are using a Ricoh PDF printer that returns\nmedia information in JMF, tolerance values are not considered when comparing media objects.\nTo set tolerances for media objects:\n1. Determine the size, weight, and recycled content values for different media objects that you want RICOH ProcessDirector to recognize as\nthe same media object.\nFor example, one printer reports the weight of plain letter paper as 81 gsm. Another printer reports 80 gsm. A third printer reports 83 gsm.\nIf the media object’s Media weight property is 81 gsm, set the Weight tolerance property to at least 2 gsm. RICOH ProcessDirector then\nspecifies the same plain letter media for all three printers.\n2. Click the Administration tab.\n3. In the left pane, click Media ⇒ Media Settings.\n4. Type values for Size tolerance, Weight tolerance, and Recycled content tolerance.\n5. Click SAVE.\nParent topic: Configuring media\n1 of 1"}]}
