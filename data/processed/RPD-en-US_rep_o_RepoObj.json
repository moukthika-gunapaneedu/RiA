When you retrieve the job or document\ninformation, you can view the job, submit it again, or review detailed information about the job or document and its processing history. You can\ncreate multiple repositories, each with a unique retention period.\nWhen you create a repository object, you can specify:\nThe retention period for the repository. Objects older than the retention period are deleted by the system.\nThe path to the file system or directory for the repository folder. This file system or directory can reside on the local machine or on a mounted\ndrive anywhere on your network.\nA repository location. This value can be used to control who can retrieve files from the repository.\nThe job and document properties to be used in retrieving jobs, documents, and history information from the repository are specified in the\nStoreInRepository step of the workflow. Job history information is recorded by a history record notification object. You can specify whether the\nStoreInRepository step saves the history information as well as the job and document data.\nRICOH ProcessDirector supplies a sample repository that you can use to experiment with storing and retrieving jobs and documents.\nParent topic: System objects\n1 of 1"}]}
