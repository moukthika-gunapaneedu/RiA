If they apply, RICOH ProcessDirector adjusts the planned\ncheckpoints of jobs so that they do not occur during the no-service periods.\nAll the no-service periods work together as one unit. A service policy can specify whether all the no-service periods apply to the policy. However,\na service policy cannot specify which no-service periods apply.\nIf a no-service period applies to every day of a month or year, you can select All in the Day property. However, if a no-service period applies to\nevery day of a week, you must create one no-service period for each day. For example, if no service is provided:\nFrom 16:00 to 23:59 every day of the year, create 1 no-service period object and select All in the Day property.\nFor one week in a year, create 7 no-service period objects: one for each date.\nTo create a no-service period:\n1. Click the Administration tab.\n2. In the left pane, click Objects ⇒ No-Service Periods.\n3. Click Add.\n4. Fill in the required and optional properties. To see information about any of the properties, click the icon next to the property name.\n5. Click OK.\nNote:\nNo-service periods are not considered for deadlines set with the SetDeadline step in a workflow or the Change Deadline action on\nthe job.\nParent topic: Setting up no-service periods\n1 of 1"}]}
