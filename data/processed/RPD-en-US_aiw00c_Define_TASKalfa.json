Jobs are\nassigned to TASKalfa printers using scheduling properties.\nJobs are assigned to TASKalfa printer using these scheduling properties: Customer name, Job size, Location, Media, Output bin, Output format,\nFolding, Perfect binding, Ring binding, Punch, and Staple. Other scheduling properties may be defined in a configuration file.\nTo print jobs in PDF format using a TASKalfa printer, you must first install the Cut Sheet Support for TASKalfa feature.\nTo define a TASKalfa printer object:\n1. Click the Administration tab.\n2. In the left pane, click Devices ⇒ Printers.\n3. Click Add ⇒ TASKalfa Printer.\n4. On the General tab, fill in values for all the required fields.\nNote:\nThe printer driver reports status information only in English. The TASKalfa printers do not support different languages for printer\nmessages.\nSNMP returns the printer serial number when RICOH ProcessDirector establishes a connection to the printer. RICOH ProcessDirector\nchecks the Serial number property to make sure that the printer is one of the models supported as TASKalfa printers.\nThe default value for the Job status polling interval property is 10 seconds. If you want to reduce the traffic on your network, you\ncan increase the interval between RICOH ProcessDirector requests to the printer for job status.\n5. On the Scheduling tab, enter the values that you want RICOH ProcessDirector to use to assign jobs to this printer. Leave the values blank or\nNot set for any properties that you do not want to use for scheduling. Those values match any values specified by the corresponding job\nscheduling properties.\nIf you want to schedule jobs to a printer based on media, keep these items in mind when you set the Media supported property:\nIf you choose specific media, only jobs that use that media can be scheduled to this printer.\nIf you choose Ready media objects, only jobs that require the media that is currently loaded in the printer can be scheduled to the printer.\nIf you choose All media, all jobs can be scheduled to the printer, regardless of what media is loaded.\n6. Click OK.\nNote:\nRICOH ProcessDirector creates a separate Java virtual machine on the parent server to run TASKalfa printers. Some computer\nsecurity software notifies users when Java virtual machines are created.\nEFI Fiery controllers return information to RICOH ProcessDirector. For EFI Fiery controllers, the % Printed property shows the job\ntransmission status. Print progress is complete when EFI Fiery controllers have queued an entire job for printing. EFI Fiery controllers\ncan be configured to print queued jobs in the order received or to hold them for later printing.\nOnly TASKalfa printers that have an EFI Fiery digital front end support JDF/PDF. For a list of control units that support this data\nstream, see the readme.txt file. After you add a TASKalfa printer on a Linux server, the readme.txt file is in the\n/opt/infoprint/ippd/pc directory. After you add a TASKalfa printer on an application server, the readme.txt file is in the\nC:\\Program Files\\Ricoh\\ProcessDirector\\pc directory.\nParent topic: Defining printer objects\n1 of 1"}]}
