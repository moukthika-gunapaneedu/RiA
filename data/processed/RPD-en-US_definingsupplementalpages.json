For example, header and\ntrailer pages, separator pages, and any page that should be excluded from a customer statement can be defined as supplemental pages.\nYou can define supplemental pages with one or more triggers or index tags to uniquely identify a page that is outside a page group. When you\ndefine a supplemental page, you give it a page definition name. This lets you define multiple supplemental pages.\nNote: The term “page definition” in AFP Indexer refers to a supplemental page definition, a page-level trigger, or a page-level index, not\nthe AFP page definition resource.\nIn this section:\nCreating triggers for supplemental pages\nYou can define supplemental pages by creating one or more triggers. A trigger is a block of text that occurs in a consistent location and uniquely\nidentifies a page.\nCreating index tags on supplemental pages\nYou can create one or more index tags on pages that are not included in page groups.\nParent topic: Indexing AFP files\n1 of 1"}]}
