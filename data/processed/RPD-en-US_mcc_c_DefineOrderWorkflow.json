The CallSOAPService step calls the Job Ticket MarcomCentral web service and retrieves job tickets by order\nnumber. Modify that step and others in the workflow by setting the step properties to values that work with your MarcomCentral store and\nRICOH ProcessDirector workflows.\nThe workflow that processes MarcomCentral orders receives jobs from the SOAP web service input device.\nBefore you define the workflow:\nPlan how to process the orders, including how to map XML elements in the orders to RICOH ProcessDirector order and job properties using an\norder property mapping object.\nPrepare to call MarcomCentral web services.\nDefine a SOAP web service input device.\nDefine an order property mapping object.\nFor more information, see the related tasks.\nTo define a workflow to process MarcomCentral orders:\n1. Click the Workflow tab.\n2. Right-click the MarcomProcessOrders workflow and select Copy.\n3. Name the copy of the workflow, fill in or edit other values that you need, and click Continue.\n4. In the workflow editor, right-click the CreateOrdersFromFile step and select Properties.\n5. On the Create Orders tab, update the properties appropriately for your MarcomCentral jobs, including choosing the property mapping\nobject that interprets your order XML files and the correct workflow to process jobs created.\n6. For the RetainCompletedJobs step, set the Retention period property to an appropriate value for your site.\n7. Save and enable the workflow.\n8. Connect the workflow to the input device that you defined to retrieve MarcomCentral orders:\n1. Click the Administration tab.\n2. In the left pane, click Devices ⇒ Input Devices.\n3. Right-click the input device and select Properties.\n4. On the General tab, set the Child workflow property to the name of the workflow that you defined to process MarcomCentral\norders.\nAfter you define a workflow to process MarcomCentral job tickets, set the Workflow for new jobs property of the CreateJobsFromXML step to\nthe name of the job ticket workflow.\nParent topic: Setting up to process orders from MarcomCentral\n1 of 1"}]}
