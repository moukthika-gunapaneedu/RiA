Objects include servers, notifications, media, and devices such as input devices\nand printers. Features might add other kinds of objects as well.\nAn input device can receive input files if it is connected and disabled, but it must be enabled to create RICOH ProcessDirector jobs and send\nthose jobs for further processing.\nTo enable an object, do one of these:\nFrom the Main page:\n1. Find the object in its portal.\n2. Right-click the object and select Enable.\nFrom the Administration page:\n1. In the left pane, click the object type.\n2. In the table, right-click the object and select Enable.\nNote:\nAfter RICOH ProcessDirector enables an input device or printer, the symbol next to it changes to the enabled symbol, which is a solid\ngreen arrow.\nAfter a system shutdown and restart, all the printers are disabled. If you want all the printers that were enabled before the shutdown to\nbe enabled after the system is restarted, you can change the Remember enabled status of printers property value to Yes on the System\npage of the Administration tab.\nSecondary servers enable any input devices and printers that the server manages.\nParent topic: Managing system objects\n1 of 1"}]}
