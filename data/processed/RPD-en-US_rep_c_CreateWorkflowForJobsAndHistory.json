Click the Workflow tab.\n2. Right-click a workflow that you want to have write information to a repository and select Copy.\n3. Name the copy of the workflow, fill in or edit other values that you need, and click Continue.\n4. Insert one or more StoreInRepository steps into the workflow after the steps whose property values or history information you want to\nstore.\n5. Right-click each of the StoreInRepository steps you added, select Properties, and then click Repository:\n1. For the Repository property, select the repository that you want to store job and document data in. If you have more than one\nStoreInRepository step, you can choose separate repositories or the same repository.\n2. For the Store history records property, change the value to Yes.\n3. If you want to store only properties and history information, clear the value of the File to store property.\n4. If you want to store only properties, clear the value of the File to store property and set the value of the Store history records property\nto No.\n5. If you want to preserve the values of job properties for use when the job or its documents are resubmitted to a workflow:\n1. Use a text editor to create an override properties file.\n2. Place the database name of each job property on a separate line.\n3. To add a comment, place it on a separate line that starts with a pound sign (#).\nThis example shows a file with three job properties (Customer name, Media required, and Duplex) and a comment:\nJob.CustomerNameJob.MediaRequired# This is a comment.Job.Duplex\n4. Name the file, save it, and move it to a directory on the RICOH ProcessDirector primary computer. For example:\n/aiw/aiw1/control_files/job_properties.txt (Linux)\nC:\\aiw\\aiw1\\control_files\\job_properties.txt (Windows)\n5. On the StoreInRepository step, enter the path and name of the file in the Path to override properties file property.\n6. If you are using an associated properties file, enter the full path and name or the symbolic name of the file in the Associated\nproperties file property.\n7. For the Archive entry type property, enter a name that identifies the specific type of data being captured, such as Preflight, Post-Print,\nor History Information only. Alternatively, you can enter a value of Print file to indicate that this entry in the repository has the print\nfile associated with it and can therefore be viewed or resubmitted. You can use this property to search for information about the job\nyou want to retrieve.\n8. From the Available job properties to store list, select the job properties that you want to use to search for jobs in the repository.\n9. Click OK.\nNote:\nMake sure that each of the StoreInRepository steps is in the correct place in the workflow. Storing a file after steps that change the\norder of pages, such as ReversePDFPageOrder, affects your ability to search using document properties in the viewer.\n6. Optional: Right-click the RetainCompletedJobs step. Select Properties, and then click Job defaults - General. Update the value of the\nRetention period property. Click OK.\n7. Save and enable the workflow.\n8. To test the workflow:\n1. Create one or more input devices to point to the workflow.\n2. Enable the input devices.\n3. Submit your PDF or AFP print job to the input device.\n4. When the job finishes, look in the Archive to make sure that the right information was stored.\n1 of 2"}, {"page": 2, "text": "2/4/26, 2:18 PM Creating a workflow to store jobs, job properties, and job history in a repository - Jenski - Test portal- RPD Linux\nNote:\nIf a job is processed again and runs the StoreInRepository step more than once, two copies of the job are stored in the repository.\nParent topic: Workflows that store jobs and data in a repository\n2 of 2"}]}
