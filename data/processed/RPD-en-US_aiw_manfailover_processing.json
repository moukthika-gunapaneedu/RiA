Log in as the system user (aiw1 is the default) to the server you are moving processing from. If the system is not available (for example\nhardware failure or if the system is powered down), continue with step 3. If you are moving processing from the production server to the\nfailover server, log in to the production server.If you are moving processing from the failover server to the production server, log in to the\nfailover server.\n2. Open a command line and enter: stopaiw\n3. Log in as the root user to the server you are moving the processing to.\n4. Enter /opt/infoprint/ippd/bin/changeHostname.plserver_hostname where server_hostname is the name of the server\nyou are moving processing from and press Enter. If you are moving processing from the production server to the failover server,\nserver_hostname is the production server. If you are moving processing from the failover server to the production server,\nserver_hostname is the failover server.\nParent topic: RICOH ProcessDirector servers\n1 of 1"}]}
