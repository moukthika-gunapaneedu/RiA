When you view an AFP file that contains\npage groups and indexes in RICOH ProcessDirector, you can navigate in the file to find pages containing specific index values.\nYou can also reprint all the pages in one or more page groups. In addition, AFP Editor, Document Property Designer, and Whitespace Manager\ncan use the page groups and index values to define barcodes, text strings, and white space.\nIn this section:\nPage groups\nAFP Indexer lets you organize a large AFP file into smaller, uniquely identifiable units, called page groups.\nSupplemental pages\nAFP Indexer lets you define pages in an AFP file as supplemental pages. Supplemental pages are those pages that you do not want included in\npage groups, such as header and trailer pages, separator pages, or any page that should be excluded from a customer statement.\nIndex tags\nThe AFP Indexer mode of RICOH Visual Workbench lets you index data values that are consistently present in the same location in each page\ngroup or on a supplemental page. Index tags define the data values on a page. (Index tags are called Tag Logical Elements (TLEs) in the AFP\narchitecture.)\nParent topic: RICOH Visual Workbench\n1 of 1"}]}
