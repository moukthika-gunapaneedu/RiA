In the Printers Portlet, right-click the printer that you want to start or stop and select Start or Stop.\n2. Specify when you want the AFP printer to stop printing:\nImmediately stops the printer as soon as possible.\nAfter the current copy prints stops the printer after it finishes printing the current copy of a multi-copy job.\nAfter all copies of the current job print stops the printer when the current job is finished.\n3. Optional: To advance the paper so that the last page of printed output is stacked after the printer is stopped, select After stopping,\nperform a non-process runout (NPRO) operation.\n4. If you see a confirmation message, click OK.\nAfter stopping a printer:\nThe printer status changes to Stopped and the printer icon in the Printers portlet turns red. No jobs print on that printer until it is started again.\nThe printer is still enabled, so RICOH ProcessDirector can still schedule jobs to it.\nJobs that were assigned to the printer that has been stopped remain in the Assigned state.\nParent topic: Printers\n1 of 1"}]}
