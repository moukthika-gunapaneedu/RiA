Examples of\nenhancements include creating page groups, indexes, barcodes, and text; assigning values to document properties; and adding content to white\nspace areas. RICOH ProcessDirector then applies the same enhancements to production AFP files when it prepares them for processing.\nPage groups or documents are AFP structures that organize AFP files into smaller, uniquely identifiable units. For example, an AFP file contains\nseveral bank statements that all have the same format. Each statement is a page group. RICOH Visual Workbench lets you apply the same\nenhancements on all the page groups in the AFP file.\nModes\nRICOH Visual Workbench has these modes:\nAFP Indexer lets you create AFP page groups and indexes, and define supplemental pages.\nDocument Property Designer lets you assign values to document properties.\nAFP Enhancer lets you create barcodes and text, and hide areas that contain unwanted content, such as obsolete bar codes.\nPipeline Manager lets you configure and run a set of filters, in a specific order, to process large AFP files quickly and efficiently.\nRICOH Visual Workbench, AFP Indexer, Document Property Designer, Pipeline Manager, and AFP Enhancer are all part of the AFP Support\nfeature.\nPlug-ins\nTwo components plug in to RICOH Visual Workbench:\nThe AFP Editor component, like AFP Enhancer, lets you create barcodes and text, and hide areas that contain unwanted content. In addition,\nAFP Editor lets you:\nCreate PDF417 barcodes.\nAutomatically replace POSTNET barcodes with Intelligent Mail barcodes that have the same routing code.\nCreate a condition between two barcodes that determines which barcode is created in a page group.\nThe Whitespace Manager component lets you define available areas of white space in AFP files and then fill the white space with content, such\nas images and text, during the production process.\nControl files\nRICOH Visual Workbench creates two control files:\nVisual Workbench control file\nWhen you enhance a sample AFP file with any of the modes or plug-ins, RICOH Visual Workbench creates a Visual Workbench control file with\ninformation about the enhancements you made. One or more steps in the workflow use the control file to apply all the enhancements, except\nthose made with AFP Enhancer, to production AFP files.\nEnhanceAFP control file\nOne or more steps in the workflow use the EnhanceAFP control file to apply all the enhancements made with AFP Enhancer to production AFP\nfiles. You export the EnhanceAFP control file when you are ready to use it in a workflow. If you want to make more enhancements with AFP\nEnhancer after you export the EnhanceAFP control file, first you load the Visual Workbench control file that contains the original\nenhancements. You use AFP Enhancer to make the additional enhancements and save the Visual Workbench control file. Then you export an\nupdated version of the EnhanceAFP control file to apply the new enhancements to the workflow.\nUser interface\nThe RICOH Visual Workbench user interface displays the sample AFP file and lets you select modes and plug-in features to enhance the file. The\nuser interface lets you interact with the file by clicking text to select it and drawing boxes to indicate positions. For example:\nYou click text that you want to index or use as a trigger to create page groups.\nYou draw a box you where you want to create a barcode or text.\nAFP data requirements\nAFP files that contain data in Mixed Object Document Content Architecture for Presentation (MO:DCA-P) format are required for use with RICOH\nVisual Workbench.\nIn this section:\nUser interface\nYou use the RICOH Visual Workbench user interface to display and enhance sample AFP files.\n1 of 2"}, {"page": 2, "text": "2/4/26, 2:24 PM IntroductionRICOH Visual Workbench - Jenski - Test portal- RPD Linux\nControl files\nRICOH Visual Workbench control files contain information about the enhancements made to sample AFP files.

When you view an AFP file that contains\npage groups and indexes in RICOH ProcessDirector, you can navigate in the file to find pages containing specific index values.\nPipeline Manager\nPipeline Manager mode of RICOH Visual Workbench lets you configure and run a set of filters, in a specific order, to process large AFP files\nquickly and efficiently.\nAFP Enhancer\nAFP Enhancer mode of RICOH Visual Workbench lets you create barcodes, text, and hidden areas in documents.\nDocument Property Designer\nDocument Property Designer lets you customize document and job properties for AFP files. You can use these properties in your workflows in a\nvariety of ways.\nParent topic: AFP support for documents\n2 of 2"}]}
