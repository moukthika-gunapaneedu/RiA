With the AFP Support feature installed, it can also send jobs to IPDS printers. It can copy\nprint jobs to the hot folders that some printers, such as the InfoPrint 5000 printer, use to receive non-IPDS jobs.\nRICOH ProcessDirector supports these output formats for printers:\nAFP\nWith the AFP Support feature installed, RICOH ProcessDirector can send AFP print jobs to IPDS printers. RICOH ProcessDirector can receive\nstatus information about the job from those printers and can send requests to the printer. Those requests include interrupting a job that is\ncurrently printing or using the Jump to action to move to a different place in the job and resume printing.\nPCL\nRICOH ProcessDirector can send jobs to PCLOut printers that the printer driver component of the AFP Support feature has converted from\nAFP to PCL. RICOH ProcessDirector cannot receive status information about the job from those printers.\nPDF\nRICOH ProcessDirector can send PDF files to Ricoh TotalFlow printers.\nIf a Ricoh PDF printer supports the data stream, RICOH ProcessDirector can send the printer PDF files.\nWith the Cut Sheet Support for Kodak feature installed, RICOH ProcessDirector can send PDF files to Kodak PDF printers.\nWith the Cut Sheet Support for Xerox feature installed, RICOH ProcessDirector can send PDF files to Xerox PDF printers.\nWith the Cut Sheet Support for TASKalfa feature installed, RICOH ProcessDirector can send PDF files to TASKalfa printers.\nPostScript\nRICOH ProcessDirector can send PDF files to Ricoh PDF and Custom PDF printers by converting PDF to PostScript.\nWith the Cut Sheet Support for Kodak feature installed, RICOH ProcessDirector can send PDF files to Kodak PostScript printers by converting\nPDF to PostScript.\nOther\nRICOH ProcessDirector can send print jobs in other formats to Passthrough printers. RICOH ProcessDirector cannot receive status information\nabout the job from those printers. It can send requests to the software queue that represents the printer, but not to the printer itself.\nTo print jobs on printers that have hot folders, you can use a Passthrough printer. Configure the Passthrough printer to copy jobs to a printer hot\nfolder. The hot folder submits jobs to that printer. If you copy a print job to a hot folder, RICOH ProcessDirector cannot receive status information\nabout the job from the printer.\nNote: If RICOH ProcessDirector can access the printer hot folder as a mapped drive or mounted file system, you can use a CopytoFolder\nstep. The step submits a job to the printer. However, if you use the CopyToFolder step, you cannot use the Schedule Jobs action to assign\njobs to a printer. The CopyToFolder step does not use the Requested printer property that the Schedule Jobs action sets to assign jobs to a\nprinter.\nParent topic: Product overview\n1 of 1"}]}
