Job checkpoints let you track the progress of jobs as they flow through the system to\nsee if the jobs are on schedule to meet the performance commitments in a service level agreement (SLA). Service policies are not used when\ntracking to a schedule based on estimated durations or to a deadline set by a SetDeadline step or the Change Deadline action.\nYou can create a service policy for each performance commitment. For example, you can create one service policy for jobs that need to be\nprinted in 1 day, and another service policy for jobs that need to be printed in 2 days.\nThe service policy contains the time zone where jobs are printed. If jobs can be printed in different time zones, you can copy the service policy to\ncreate service policies for the other time zones. For example, create one service policy for the US/Eastern time zone, and then copy it to create\nanother service policy for the US/Mountain time zone.\nTo create a service policy:\n1. Click the Administration tab.\n2. In the left pane, click Objects ⇒ Service Policies.\n3. Click Add.\n4. On all the tabs, fill in the required and optional properties. To see information about any of the properties, click the icon next to the\nproperty name.\n5. Click OK.\nParent topic: Setting up service policies\n1 of 1"}]}
