The IDP ICS is based on the JDF\ncombined digital printing process, which is intended for integrated digital printers.\nRICOH ProcessDirector does not support all possible values in the JDF job ticket. If RICOH ProcessDirector cannot use a value to set a job\nproperty, it will remove unsupported values from the job ticket.\nNote:\nThe IdentifyPDFDocuments step can receive multiple sets of PDF files and job tickets. The step combines them into a single PDF file and a\nsingle job ticket. When the step creates the combined job ticket, it includes only values that RICOH ProcessDirector supports. It does not\ninclude unsupported values in the combined job ticket. The IdentifyPDFDocuments step is provided by the PDF Document Support\nfeature.\nAfter the property values are set, RICOH ProcessDirector stores the job ticket with the job files. If the job ticket is requested by a step, RICOH\nProcessDirector updates the job ticket with the most current job property values in its database and sends the job ticket to the application called\nby the step. When the application returns the JDF job ticket, RICOH ProcessDirector updates any supported job property values that have\nchanged, and these can be seen in the job property notebook in RICOH ProcessDirector.\nThe value of the Media property is a special case, because it depends on the setting for Media Matching:\nIf Media Matching is set to Use media product ID or media name, RICOH ProcessDirector uses one of these media names as the value of the\nMedia property for a job:\nThe name of the media object with the matching product ID specified in the job ticket.\nThe name of the media specified in the job ticket.\nRICOH ProcessDirector first checks whether the job ticket specifies a media product ID. If it does, RICOH ProcessDirector looks for a system\nmedia object with the same product ID. If RICOH ProcessDirector finds a match, it puts the name of the matching media object in the Media\nproperty for the job. If RICOH ProcessDirector does not find a match, it looks for a media object with the media name specified in the JDF job\nticket. If RICOH ProcessDirector finds a match, it puts the name of the matching media object in the Media property for the job.\nIf Media Matching is set to Use the properties selected below, RICOH ProcessDirector uses the media properties (such as size) listed in the job\nticket to search the existing system media objects and find one that matches. When it finds an appropriate media object, the name of that\nobject is set as the value of the Media property for the job.\nYou can choose the properties that are used for Media Matching based on the needs of your installation.\nIf more than one media object matches, RICOH ProcessDirector tries to determine which one is the best match based on the rest of the media\nproperties in the job ticket, including the name of the media. If the system cannot determine the best match or if no media objects match, the\njob goes to Error state. You can use the Correct Media action on the job to select the media and move the job out of Error state.\nIf a job ticket specifies values for media and stapling, you can view and change them in the job properties notebook. On the Scheduling tab, the\nMedia required property lists the media values for both the job and any page exceptions. The Stapling required property shows whether stapling\nis required. You can set the job values in the Media and Staple properties on the Scheduling tab. You can change the page values on the Page\nException tab using the Page exceptions action.\nIf a job ticket specifies values for sides exceptions, you can view them using the Page Exceptions action on the job. You cannot change the Sides\npage exceptions.\nAvailable punching and stapling options vary from printer to printer. You can configure some RICOH ProcessDirector printers to be punch-capable\nor staple-capable, but you cannot configure their finishing patterns for punching or stapling. Therefore, RICOH ProcessDirector might schedule a\njob to a printer that does not support the punch or staple patterns that you requested. When this happens, the printer applies its best equivalent\npunch or staple pattern.\nParent topic: Configuring to use JDF job tickets\n1 of 1"}]}
