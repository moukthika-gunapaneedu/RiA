The\nrelationships determine how the CreateOrdersFromFile step identifies orders and the jobs they contain, and sets property values for both the\norders and jobs.\nConfiguring workflows to receive orders\nTo process order XML files generated by your ordering system, you set up a workflow that includes a step based on the CreateOrdersFromFile\nstep template. That step uses an order property mapping to define one or more orders and the jobs they contain. The step also submits those\njobs to another workflow for processing.\nParent topic: Preparing for job submission\n1 of 1"}]}
