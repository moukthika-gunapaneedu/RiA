You can use the SetDocPropsFromConditions step in\nyour workflow to set a value of a specific job property such as Doc.Insert.InserterID. In RICOH ProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat, you can\nuse the Doc.Insert.InserterID job property in a rule. RICOH ProcessDirector can apply a specific barcode or image based on the control file (which\ncontains the rules you defined in RICOH ProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat) that you add to a BuildPDFFromDocuments step.\nNote: When using a document or job property value in a rule, define your value so it matches the value of the property when RICOH\nProcessDirector processes the page groups in the PDF file. For example, the values of the Doc.Insert.InserterID job property in RICOH\nProcessDirector are 01 and 02. Use those values when you define a rule with the Doc.Insert.InserterID job property as a condition. Do not\nuse One and Two.\nParent topic: Working with rules\n1 of 1"}]}
