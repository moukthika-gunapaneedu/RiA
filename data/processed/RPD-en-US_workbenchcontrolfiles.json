A step in the workflow uses the\ncontrol file to make the same enhancements to production AFP files.\nWhen you enhance a sample AFP file, RICOH Visual Workbench creates a control file that contains information about how to make the\nenhancements. The enhancements are not made in the sample AFP file. To see the enhancements when you open the sample AFP file in a\nsubsequent session, you must also open the control file that was used to enhance the sample file.\nIf you enhance the same sample AFP file (or a similar AFP file) again in another session, RICOH Visual Workbench can use the same control file.\nAll enhancements for the sample AFP file must be defined in the same control file. RICOH Visual Workbench can add all enhancements to the\nsame control file regardless of which component you use to make the enhancements.\nUnless you change the name of the control file and its directory path, the control file has the same name as the sample AFP file with a .ctl\nextension and is saved in the same directory as the sample file. If you want to use a different naming scheme, use one that associates the sample\nAFP file with its control file. In addition, select a directory that is automatically backed up. For example, you could create directory\n/aiw/aiw1/control_files/workbench (on Linux) or C:\\aiw\\aiw1\\control_files\\workbench (on Windows) and save all control files in that\ndirectory. On Linux, permissions should be set so that the RICOH ProcessDirector system user (aiw1 is the default) or all users in the RICOH\nProcessDirector group (aiwgrp1 is the default) can read and update files in the directory.\nRICOH ProcessDirector provides step templates that use the information in the control file to make enhancements to production AFP files. You\ncan include these step templates in any workflow:\nIndexAFP: A step based on this step template uses the information in the control file to create page groups and index tags, and define\nsupplemental pages.\nEditAFP: A step based on this step template uses the information in the control file to create bar codes, text, and hidden areas. As an option,\nRICOH ProcessDirector can first create page groups and index tags that are defined in the same control file. This step template is available only\nif AFP Editor is installed.\nFillWhiteSpace: A step based on this step template uses the information in the control file to fill white space areas in AFP files with content,\nsuch as images or text. As an option, RICOH ProcessDirector can first create page groups and index tags that are defined in the same control\nfile. This step template is available only if Whitespace Manager is installed.\nIdentifyDocuments: A step based on this step template uses the information in the control file to calculate values for document properties.\nWhen you configure the step in a workflow, you can use symbolic notation for the name of the Visual Workbench control file. Symbolic notation\nlets you use the same workflow for input files that require different Visual Workbench control files. For example, if you have two input files,\nabc.afp and xyz, with corresponding control files, abc.afp.ctl and xyz.ctl, and you want to use the same workflow for both files, you can\nuse ${Job.InputFile}.ctl as the control file. ${Job.InputFile}.ctl causes RICOH ProcessDirector to set the value of the Visual Workbench\ncontrol file property to the name of the input file plus the .ctl extension.\nParent topic: RICOH Visual Workbench\n1 of 1"}]}
