Each service\npolicy specifies whether all the no-service periods apply to the service policy.\nNote: No-service periods are not considered for deadlines set with the SetDeadline step in a workflow or the Change Deadline action on\nthe job.\nRICOH ProcessDirector provides sample no-service periods that you can use. You can also create your own no-service periods.\nEach no-service period describes one period of time (for example, one holiday). All the no-service periods work together as one unit.\nA service policy can specify whether all the no-service periods apply to the policy. However, a service policy cannot specify which no-service\nperiods apply.\nTo set up no-service periods:\n1. Create one or more no-service periods, one for each time period.\n2. In each service policy, specify whether to adjust planned checkpoints for the no-service periods.\nIn this section:\nUsing supplied no-service periods\nRICOH ProcessDirector provides these predefined no-service periods: Every Saturday, Every Sunday, and January 1. You can change the properties\nof the supplied no-service periods and use them in your installation. Or, you can delete them if they are not useful.\nCreating no-service periods\nYou can create a no-service period for each time when your installation does not provide services (for example, a holiday).\nParent topic: Setting up Deadline Tracker\n1 of 1"}]}
