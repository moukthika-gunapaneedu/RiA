When you integrate web services with your application, refer\nto these usage notes to make sure that your implementation functions properly.\nYou must use the POST /users/login/ web service to establish a connection and receive a credential token from the RICOH ProcessDirector server\nbefore you can use any other web services. All of the other web services require that you include a credential token in the request header of the\nURI. If you do not, you receive an immediate 401 Unauthorized HTTP error.\nYou cannot translate actions and URIs into other languages because they are fixed-character strings. For example, \"token:\" remains the same\nfor all languages.\nRecord sets retrieved might change between invocations of any service, especially when you use sorting or filtering functions; successive\nidentical requests might not yield the same records.\nIf you activate Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) support, RICOH ProcessDirector uses the SSL protocol for all HTTP\ncommunications, including web services. If SSL or TLS support is active, you must use a web services client that supports SSL or TLS to invoke\nweb services.\nRICOH ProcessDirector web services only return JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data. XML is not supported.\nParent topic: Web services in RICOH ProcessDirector\n1 of 1"}]}
