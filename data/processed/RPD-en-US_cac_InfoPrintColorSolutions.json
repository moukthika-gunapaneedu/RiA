The color images and\nobjects print in color, based on the default settings in your print server and printer.\nIf you like the colors that the default color management settings provide, or if it is not essential that you print in exactly the right colors, you\nprobably do not need to implement a full color management solution. However, if you want better control over the consistency and accuracy of\nyour colors for devices, you might consider color management at some point in the future.\nTo understand some of the basic concepts about color printing, see:\nColor Printing Concepts\nGrayscale Printing Concepts\nResources that document composition software includes inline\nMost often, print bureaus use document composition software to generate highly customized and personalized color output. AFP color\nmanagement is largely built into the document composition tools that support their processes. The software puts all the resources that the\nprinter needs into the print job and sends it to a print server. The print server sends the print job to the printer, and the printer uses the resources\nas appropriate.\nBy using this method, you know that the required resources, including the resources required for color management, are available for any print\njob that is sent to the printer. However, including all the resources can make the print job very large, and moving large print jobs through your\nsystem might slow down system performance. Also, you might not be able to save resources that are downloaded with a print job on the printer\nso they can be reused without being downloaded later.\nFor more information about color printing, see:\nGeneral information about color printing and color management:\nColor Printing Concepts\nColor Management\nTips for images\nScenario describing a possible implementation:\nEliminating physical inserts\nFor a list of the companies that participate in the AFP Consortium and support AFP color management in their products, see:\nhttp://www.afpcinc.org\nResources stored and managed centrally\nTo take full advantage of the AFP CMOCA, you can store your color and image resources in a central resource library, and let your print system\nmanage those resources. This option optimizes system performance by:\nCreating some of the color management resources for you automatically\nReducing the number of color conversion resources that the system creates at print time by generating link color conversion color management\nresources in advance\nReducing the size of some images by removing embedded profiles when you store them, yet still retaining the association between the image\nand the profile\nLetting you mark resources as capturable, so they can be saved on the printer and used in other print jobs without being downloaded again\nFor an introduction to the full AFP CMOCA and how you might implement it, see:\nGeneral information about color and grayscale printing and color management:\nColor Printing Concepts\nGrayscale Printing Concepts\nColor Management\nAFP Color Management\nRICOH AFP Resource Installer\n1 of 2"}, {"page": 2, "text": "2/4/26, 2:22 PM AFP color and grayscale solutions - Jenski - Test portal- RPD Linux\nRICOH AFP color and grayscale products\nAFP color solution scenarios\nRelated publications\nScenario describing a possible implementation:\nReplacing pre-printed forms\nParent topic: Color and Grayscale Printing\n2 of 2"}]}
