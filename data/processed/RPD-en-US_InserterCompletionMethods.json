A job-specific results file\ncontains information for only one job. Most inserter controllers create job-specific results files.\nManual completion\nAn operator must select the Complete Insertion action to start the reconciliation process for the job.\nUse this method if the inserter controller does not create a job-specific results file after each job finishes insertion, or if it creates a job-\nspecific results file before the job has finished insertion. Gunther inserter controllers do not create a job-specific results file after each job has\nfinished insertion.\nParent topic: Inserter and Quadient Inserter Express\n1 of 1"}]}
