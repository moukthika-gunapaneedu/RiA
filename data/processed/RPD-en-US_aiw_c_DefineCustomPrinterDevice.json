These printers\ninclude some Ricoh PostScript printers and PostScript printers from other manufacturers.\nJobs are assigned to Custom PDF printers using these scheduling properties: Customer name, Job size, Location, Media, Output bin, Output\nformat, Folding, Perfect binding, Ring binding, Punch, and Staple. If the AFP Support feature is installed, these additional scheduling properties\nare available: Class, Destination, Form. Other scheduling properties may be defined in a configuration file.\nBoth Custom PDF and Passthrough printer objects can print jobs in PDF format. Custom PDF printer objects make device-specific PostScript that is\nbased on the contents of the PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file provided by the manufacturer.\nBefore you define a Custom PDF printer object, you must get a custom printer definition file from your Ricoh support representative. This file lets\nRICOH ProcessDirector create device-specific PostScript for your printer.\nTo define a Custom PDF printer object:\n1. Click the Administration tab.\n2. In the left pane, click Devices ⇒ Printers.\n3. To define a Custom PDF printer object that uses the same custom printer definition file as an existing Custom PDF printer object, right-click\nthe existing object and select Copy.\nTo define the first Custom PDF printer object that uses a custom printer definition file:\n1. Click Add ⇒ Custom PDF Printer.\n2. In the Printer server list, select the server where you want to define a Custom PDF printer device.\n3. Click Import file and the Ricoh Printer Connector page opens in a new browser tab.\n4. On the Ricoh Printer Connector page, click Import Custom Printer Definition file.\n5. Navigate to the file you want to import, and select it. RICOH ProcessDirector installs the file on the printer server.\n6. In the Custom printer type field, type the name of the custom printer definition file that you imported. Do not type the file extension.\nFor example, if you want to use KM_1250.gpz, type KM_1250.\nRICOH ProcessDirector supports custom printer definition files with GPZ and ZIP extensions.\n4. On the General tab, fill in values for all the required fields.\nNote:\nSelect a Linux primary or secondary server or a Windows application server as the Printer server. If you just imported a custom\nprinter definition file for this printer, specify the same printer server as the one you imported the file onto.\nThe printer driver reports status information in the language that you selected when you installed the RICOH ProcessDirector server.\nTo receive messages from this printer in a different language, set the Printer language property appropriately.\nSNMP returns the printer serial number when RICOH ProcessDirector establishes a connection to the printer. RICOH ProcessDirector\nchecks the Serial number property to make sure that the printer is one of the models supported as Custom PDF printers.\nThe default value for the Job status polling interval property is 10 seconds. If you want to reduce the traffic on your network, you\ncan increase the interval between RICOH ProcessDirector requests to the printer for job status.\n5. On the Scheduling tab, enter the values that you want RICOH ProcessDirector to use to assign jobs to this printer. Leave the values blank or\nNot set for any properties that are not used for scheduling. Those values match any values specified by the corresponding job scheduling\nproperties.\nIf you want to schedule jobs to a printer based on media, keep these items in mind when you set the Media supported property:\nIf you choose specific media, only jobs that use that media can be scheduled to this printer.\nIf you choose Ready media objects, only jobs that require the media that is currently loaded in the printer can be scheduled to the printer.\nIf you choose All media, all jobs can be scheduled to the printer, regardless of what media is loaded.\n6. Click OK.\nNote:\nRICOH ProcessDirector creates a separate Java virtual machine on the Linux primary or secondary server or on the application server\nto run Custom PDF printers. Some computer security software notifies users when Java virtual machines are created.\nParent topic: Defining Custom PDF printers\n1 of 1"}]}
