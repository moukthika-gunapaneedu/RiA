You can do a variety of tasks for printers, such as starting,\nstopping, enabling, and disabling them.\nIn this section:\nCustomizing the Printers portlet\nYou can change the Printers portlet so it shows only the printers that you work with frequently. You can sort the list of printers, and you can\nchange the properties that are displayed.\nViewing printer status\nThe operational status of a printer device includes whether it is enabled, and the current condition that the printer hardware is reporting to\nRICOH ProcessDirector.\nStarting and stopping printers\nYou can start or stop a RICOH ProcessDirector printer. Starting a printer lets users send jobs to it. You can stop printing during or after the current\njob.\nSpacing a job on the printer\nIf you have a job on an AFP printer and need to reposition it to print again from an earlier page (backspace) or to skip pages and start printing at\na later page (forwardspace), you can use the Jump to job action.\nViewing and updating the media ready in printer input trays\nRICOH ProcessDirector uses SNMP and JMF to distinguish between the media that a printer supports and the media that is ready in its input\ntrays. Supported media is not ready until it is loaded in an input tray. Unless your printer can automatically match media, update the ready media\nfor the printer object when you load new media in the printer device.\nShutting down printers\nYou can instruct RICOH ProcessDirector to end all processing for a printer and its assigned jobs and to disable the printer.\nParent topic: Managing system objects\n1 of 1"}]}
