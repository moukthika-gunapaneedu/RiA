If your workflows require processing by\napplications that run on Windows, you can access those applications by installing RICOH ProcessDirector application server code on a Windows\ncomputer.\nApplication servers share the database that the primary server uses and work with the primary server to process jobs effectively. Because\napplication servers are installed on Windows computers, they can run steps that require applications on Windows. They cannot run other steps,\nsuch as PrintJobs.\nApplication servers can be the parent servers for Ricoh PDF printers, Custom PDF printers, and Passthrough printers. They cannot be the parent\nservers for other kinds of printers.\nYou can install application servers on these operating systems:\nWindows 10 Pro or Enterprise 64-bit\nWindows 11 Pro\nWindows Server 2019 64-bit\nWindows Server 2022 64-bit\nWindows Server 2025 64-bit\nParent topic: System objects\n1 of 1"}]}
