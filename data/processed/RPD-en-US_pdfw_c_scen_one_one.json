The administrator wants to sort the job alphabetically according to customer last\nname.\nRICOH ProcessDirector supports job sorting using the document properties file. The document database is not required because the same input\nfile is used for both the original job and the production job.\n1. You create a SortJob workflow to receive and prepare the incoming data. You base SortJob on the sample SortPDF workflow that PDF\nDocument Support installs.\n2. In your new workflow, SortJob, you specify a RICOH ProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat control file in the IdentifyPDFDocuments\nstep. This step creates a document properties file containing document property values for each document in the job.\n3. You specify the sorting properties in the SortDocuments step to the Assemble phase.\n4. You define the BuildPDFFromDocuments step to update the PDF file for Job 1001 to put the documents in their sorted order. In this step,\nyou also specify the RICOH ProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat control files that add markup to PDF files that you process using this\nworkflow.\nParent topic: Usage scenarios for PDF jobs\n1 of 1"}]}
