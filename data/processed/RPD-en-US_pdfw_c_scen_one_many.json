Benefits of this approach is that it might reduce overall printing\ntime or share your printing resources.\nIn this example, an application produces one large job with 80,000 documents. The administrator wants to split the job to print 40,000\ndocuments on one printer and the rest on another.\nRICOH ProcessDirector supports job splitting using the document properties file. A document database is not required because the same input\nfile is used for both the original job and the production job.\n1. You create a new workflow named LargeApp to receive and prepare the incoming data. For example, you can copy the SortSplitPDF\nworkflow into a new workflow and name it LargeApp.\n2. In your new workflow, LargeApp, you specify a RICOH ProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat control file in the IdentifyPDFDocuments\nstep. This step creates a document properties file containing document property values for each document in the job.\n3. You define the SplitDocuments step in the Assemble phase to divide the job into the specified segments. If you do not want to sort or\ngroup documents, delete the steps that don't apply to your new workflow.\n4. You define the CreateJobsFromDocuments step which creates two production jobs (child jobs). In the CreateJobsFromDocuments step, you\ndefine the names of the RICOH ProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat control files that add markup the PDF file.\n5. For the child jobs, you can either use the AssemblePDF workflow or create a copy of that workflow to define a specific workflow to print\nthe child jobs.\nParent topic: Usage scenarios for PDF jobs\n1 of 1"}]}
