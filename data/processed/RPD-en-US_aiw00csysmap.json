When the job ticket is placed in the Hot folder, RICOH ProcessDirector reads it and searches for the input files that it lists.\nIf the file paths in the job ticket do not match the directory names on a mounted file system, RICOH ProcessDirector uses a file system mapping\nfile to search for the input files.\nRICOH ProcessDirector provides a sample file system mapping file, system_map.cfg, in /aiw/aiw1/samples/config/. You can copy and edit\nthis file as necessary. Copy the file to the /aiw/aiw1/control_files/config/ directory before customizing it. Comments in the sample file\nexplain the file format.\nTo specify the file system mapping file:\n1. Click the Administration tab.\n2. In the left pane, click Settings ⇒ System.\n3. In the File system mapping file field, type the file path of the mapping file.\n4. Click SAVE.\nYou do not have to restart the system.\nParent topic: Configuring to use JDF job tickets\n1 of 1"}]}
