For Ricoh PDF Printers,\nyou can also configure RICOH ProcessDirector to use product IDs to match media. After you configure media, the media requested by a job can\nbe reliably matched with media available in the printer selected to print the job.\nIn this section:\nDefining media objects\nMedia objects represent the paper, forms, or envelopes that jobs are printed on. RICOH ProcessDirector uses them to schedule jobs to printers.\nSetting tolerances for media objects\nSetting tolerance values for media size, media weight, and recycled content lets RICOH ProcessDirector account for small differences in the values\nthat different printers report for the same media.\nConfiguring printers to automatically match media\nIf your printer can detect media information and send it over SNMP or JMF, you can have RICOH ProcessDirector automatically match the media\nrequested by a job with the media ready in the input trays for your printers.\nMedia detection\nMedia detection refers to two actions that RICOH ProcessDirector must take when it sends jobs to cut sheet printers: determining what media a\njob should be printed on and determining what media is loaded in a printer. When RICOH ProcessDirector establishes that information, it can\nschedule jobs correctly.\nConfiguring to send media product IDs to Ricoh PDF printers\nIf the control unit of a Ricoh PDF printer can use product IDs to select media, you can configure RICOH ProcessDirector to send product IDs.\nParent topic: Configuring\n1 of 1"}]}
