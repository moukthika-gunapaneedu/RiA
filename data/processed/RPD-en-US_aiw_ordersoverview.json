Creating an order makes it easier to handle multiple jobs, making\nsure that all jobs within an order are managed together and completed in a coordinated manner.\nYou can create an order in these ways:\nYou can create an order manually on the Main page, by submitting jobs on the Submit Jobs portlet and selecting a workflow for processing.\nYou can create an order automatically by submitting an XML file from your existing order processing system.\nWhen you create an order, you set default properties, such as customer and order name, location, priority, and due date. Some properties\n(Copies, Customer name, Location, and Priority) are automatically passed to all the jobs associated with that order.\nIf changes are made to these settings after orders are created, the related job settings are adjusted automatically. However, if you edit a\nparticular job setting, the change only impacts that specific job and does not alter the original order configuration.\nAfter that, the created orders can be viewed and managed in the Orders portlet.\nOnce all jobs from an order have completed processing and arrived in the Complete phase, the order is considered complete.\nIf you do not want to use the supplied order properties or need custom properties for values that do not match the available options, you can\ndefine your own in the Administration tab. You can also set default values for these properties within your workflows.\nWhen you create a custom order property, you can choose the database name and the label that displays in property notebooks and column\nheadings. You can also choose what kind of data to store in the property and the default access that different user groups have for the property.\nParent topic: System objects\n1 of 1"}]}
