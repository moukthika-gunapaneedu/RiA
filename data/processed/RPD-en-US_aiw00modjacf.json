Control files that\nuse RICOH ProcessDirector symbol notation determine the values that RICOH ProcessDirector writes to the audit files for a job.\nTo configure control files for job audit information:\n1. Log in to the primary computer as the RICOH ProcessDirector system user ( aiw1 is the default).\n2. Navigate to /aiw/aiw1/samples/audit/.\n3. Copy the control file you want to modify to the /aiw/aiw1/control_files/audit/ directory.\n4. Use an editor, such as vi, to open the control file whose content you want to view or modify:\nAudit control file for jobs Purpose\njob_info_properties.cfg Defines the content of the jobnumber.yy-mm-dd_hh-mm-\nss.job_info_properties.cfg.csv audit file in the\n/aiw/aiw1/audit/Job directory. If the AFP Support feature is\ninstalled, records JCL information about jobs that are sent through\nDownload for z/OS or AFP Download Plus.\njob_properties.cfg Defines the content of the jobnumber.yy-mm-dd_hh-mm-\nss.job_properties.cfg.csv audit file. Records basic job\ninformation for all jobs.\nline2afp_properties.cfg Defines the content of the jobnumber.yy-mm-dd_hh-mm-\nss.line2afp_properties.cfg.csv audit file. Records\ninformation that is specific to jobs whose workflow includes a step\nthat uses line2afp to convert the job to the AFP format. This file is\nprovided by the AFP Support feature.\nprint_properties.cfg Defines the content of the jobnumber.yy-mm-dd_hh-mm-\nss.print_properties.cfg.csv audit file. Records information\nthat is specific to jobs whose workflow includes a print step.\ntransform_properties.cfg Defines the content of the jobnumber.yy-mm-dd_hh-mm-\nss.transform_properties.cfg audit file. Records processing\ninformation that is specific to jobs whose workflow includes a step\nthat calls a data transform program.\n5. Review the properties that the control file specifies, and either add or delete properties as required. Initially specify the properties by their\nRICOH ProcessDirector database names in a comma-separated string. The second string that repeats the job properties and that includes\nquotation marks, delimits the comma-separated value string in the resulting audit file. These are examples of the strings formats in the\njob_properties.cfg file, and how the audit information displays in the resulting jobnumber.yy-mm-dd_hh-mm-\nss.job_properties.cfg.csv audit file:\nJob.ID,Job.CustomerName,Job.Description\n\"Job.ID\",\"Job.CustomerName\",\"Job.Description\"\nJob.ID,Job.CustomerName,Job.Description\n\"10000021.8\",\"IBM\",\"Monthly workload statistics\"\n6. Save the changed file to the /aiw/aiw1/control_files/audit/ directory and close the file.\n7. To prevent an audit file from being written, delete the corresponding control file from the /aiw/aiw1/control_files/audit/ directory.\nParent topic: Configuring\n1 of 1"}]}
