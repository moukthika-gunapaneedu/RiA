You can purchase transforms for the input and output data streams that you\nneed.\nTransforms to and from these data streams are available:\nAFP\nBMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF (only as input data stream)\nPCL\nPDF\nPostScript\nWhen you order the Advanced Transform feature, you specify which input data stream transforms and which output data stream transforms you\nneed. When you configure workflows, you can combine the input and output data stream transforms as needed.\nNote:\nWhen you send jobs with PDF or image files included in the AFP object containers, you must install the appropriate input data stream\ntransform to process them correctly. For example, for AFP files containing images, you must use the InputImage transform. When\ninstalled, the InputImage transform converts automatically the jobs containing the supported images. For AFP files containing PDF data,\nyou must install both the InputAFP and InputPDF transforms.\nAfter you install and activate the Advanced Transform feature, you must install each input and output datastream transform you want to use.\nEach transform is licensed separately, so you can choose exactly which inputs and outputs you need.\nNote: The InputPDF transform is a prerequisite for the InputImage transform.\nParent topic: Datastream transforms\n1 of 1"}]}
