However, you\nmight need to start the base product or a secondary server without restarting the entire operating system.\nAfter a system shutdown and restart, all the printers are disabled. If you want all the printers that were enabled before the shutdown to be\nenabled after the system is restarted, you can change the Remember enabled status of printers system property to Yes.\nTo start the base product or remote secondary servers:\n1. Log in to the system as the RICOH ProcessDirector system user ( aiw1 is the default).\n2. Access the command line.\n3. Enter this command:\nstartaiw\n4. If the startaiw command fails, enter these commands:\nstopaiw\nstartaiw\nOn the primary computer, the command starts the primary server, local secondary servers, the user interface program, and the information\ncenter. On a secondary computer, the secondary server starts and connects to the primary server.\nIn this section:\nDeactivating the base product or secondary server autostart script\nIf you do not want the RICOH ProcessDirector base product or secondary servers to start automatically when you restart the system on which\nthey are installed, you can deactivate the autostart script.\nActivating the primary or secondary server autostart script\nIf you previously deactivated the autostart script on the system, you can reactivate it.
