You can also specify on which pages in each page group to place the barcode.\nThis figure shows four barcode areas with different orientations (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) of the barcode symbol. It also shows the barcode area\norigin, width, and height that you specify on the Position tab for each area.\nBarcode areas with four orientations of barcode symbol\nIn the figure, the asterisk (*) indicates the origin of the barcode symbol. AFP Editor automatically determines the origin of the barcode symbol.\nThe barcode symbol origin is different for each orientation:\nOrientation of symbol Origin of symbol\n0 degrees Top-left corner of barcode area\n90 degrees Top-right corner of barcode area\n180 degrees Bottom-right corner of barcode area\n270 degrees Bottom-left corner of barcode area\nNote: When you create BCOCA objects, the barcode area must be large enough to contain the largest barcode symbol and human-\nreadable interpretation (HRI), if any, in each page group. If any part of the barcode symbol or HRI extends outside of the barcode area, the\nprinter reports an exception and does not print the barcode correctly. To stop printing a job when a presentation error occurs for a printer,\nyou can set the Presentation check errors property for the printer to Barcode or All. When you create text IMBs, the size of the barcode\narea is ignored.\nFields on the Position tab\n1 of 2"}, {"page": 2, "text": "2/4/26, 2:14 PM Position tab - Jenski - Test portal- RPD Linux\nField Value Description\nOrigin of area: X position Any decimal value, such as The horizontal distance (in inches or millimeters) of the left side of the barcode area\n2.5.
