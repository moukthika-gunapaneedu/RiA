After you create\nlocations, you can use them to restrict access to objects. Many objects have a Location property, including printers and jobs.\nLocation settings apply to both the Main page and the Administration page. Administrators determine what locations each user or members of a\ngroup are allowed to see. Users can then select which locations to show using the Preferences dialog. If locations are set for groups, each user\nwho belongs to a group inherits the group locations. If a user added to the group has access to other locations, the group locations are added to\ntheir existing locations. Administrators can also prohibit users from changing the locations they choose to show. Allowed locations inherited from\nthe group are displayed, but cannot be removed.\nParent topic: System objects\n1 of 1"}]}
