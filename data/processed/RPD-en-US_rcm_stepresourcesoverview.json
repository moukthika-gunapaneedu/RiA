Some step templates allow you to specify a file for the step to\nuse when processing jobs. Some of these files might be created on your workstation but need to be available to the workflow when it processes\njobs. You can view, retrieve, and replace the file by editing the step resource object.\nFor example, the RICOH ProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat is used inside Adobe Acrobat Professional to identify documents within a PDF\nfile and extract document properties for each document in a PDF job. The plug-in produces a control file that is used by the\nIdentifyPDFDocuments step. To have the file ready when the step runs in a workflow, you create a Step resource object by uploading the file.\nThen you select that step resource as a value for the Identify PDF control file property on the IdentifyPDFDocuments step.\nParent topic: System objects\n1 of 1"}]}
