The AFP Support feature adds Class, Destination, and Form to the scheduling\nproperties. Other scheduling properties may be defined in a configuration file.\nBoth Ricoh PDF printer objects and Passthrough printer objects can print jobs in PDF format. Ricoh PDF printer objects support more functions\nsuch as reporting job progress. If Ricoh PDF printer objects support your printer model, we recommend that you define a Ricoh PDF printer object\nrather than a Passthrough printer object.\nTo define a Ricoh PDF printer object:\n1. Click the Administration tab.\n2. In the left pane, click Devices ⇒ Printers.\n3. Click Add ⇒ Ricoh PDF Printer.\n4. On the General tab, fill in values for all the required fields.\nNote:\nSelect a Linux primary or secondary server or a Windows application server as the Printer server.\nThe printer driver reports status information in the language that you selected when you installed the RICOH ProcessDirector server.\nTo receive messages from this printer in a different language, set the Printer language property appropriately.\nSNMP returns the printer serial number when RICOH ProcessDirector establishes a connection to the printer. RICOH ProcessDirector\nchecks the Serial number property to make sure that the printer is one of the models supported as Ricoh PDF printers.\nThe default value for the Job status polling interval property is 10 seconds. If you want to reduce the traffic on your network, you\ncan increase the interval between RICOH ProcessDirector requests to the printer for job status.\n5. On the Scheduling tab, enter the values that you want RICOH ProcessDirector to use to assign jobs to this printer. Leave the values blank or\nNot set for any properties that you do not want to use for scheduling. Those values match any values specified by the corresponding job\nscheduling properties.\nIf you want to schedule jobs to a printer based on media, keep these items in mind when you set the Media supported property:\nIf you choose specific media, only jobs that use that media can be scheduled to this printer.\nIf you choose Ready media objects, only jobs that require the media that is currently loaded in the printer can be scheduled to the printer.\nIf you choose All media, all jobs can be scheduled to the printer, regardless of what media is loaded.\n6. Click OK.\nNote:\nRICOH ProcessDirector creates a separate Java virtual machine on the Linux primary or secondary server or on the application server\nto run Ricoh PDF printers. Some computer security software notifies users when Java virtual machines are created.\nSupported RICOH printers work with RICOH or EFI Fiery printer controllers. Both Ricoh and EFI Fiery controllers return information\nto RICOH ProcessDirector. For RICOH controllers, the % Printed property shows the percentage of pages printed. For EFI Fiery\ncontrollers, the % Printed property shows the job transmission status. Print progress is complete when EFI Fiery controllers have\nqueued an entire job for printing. EFI Fiery controllers can be configured to print queued jobs in the order received or to hold them\nfor later printing.\nUse the Data stream to send property to choose whether to send PDF files and JDF job tickets or to send PostScript data to the\nprinter.\nOnly Ricoh PDF printers that have TotalFlow Print Server or an EFI Fiery control unit support JDF/PDF.\nParent topic: Defining printer objects\n1 of 1"}]}
