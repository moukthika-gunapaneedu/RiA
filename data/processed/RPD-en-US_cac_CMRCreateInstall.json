You can also\ncreate CMRs yourself, based on your needs.\nThe AFP Consortium, the group that defined the AFP Color Management Object Content Architecture (CMOCA), identified a set of color\nconversion CMRs that are most often used in audit processing mode. The set includes color conversion CMRs for common color spaces, such as:\nAdobe RGB (1998)\nsRGB\nSMPTE-C RGB\nSWOP CMYK\nThe standard CMRs are included with AFP Resource Installer, although they are not installed by default. You can install the standard CMRs that\nyou plan to use. In addition, AFP Resource Installer automatically installs all the generic halftone and tone transfer curve CMRs in any resource\nlibrary you create.\nIf you need more CMRs, you can create them by using wizards provided in AFP Resource Installer. See the online help for details about the\nwizard.\nIf you use AFP Resource Installer to create a CMR, the software automatically installs the CMR in a resource library. You can also use AFP\nResource Installer to install CMRs that you get from your printer manufacturer.\nParent topic: Color Management Resources\n1 of 1"}]}
