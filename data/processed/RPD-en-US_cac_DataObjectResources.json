These data objects\ncan be placed directly in a page or overlay or can be defined as resources and included in pages or overlays. Using a data object as a resource is\nmore efficient when that object appears more than once in a print job; resources are downloaded to the printer just once and referenced as\nneeded.\nData objects can either be included inline with a print job or installed in a resource library by using software such as AFP Resource Installer. If you\ninstall your data objects in a resource library, you can associate color conversion CMRs with them.\nIn this section:\nTypes of Data Objects\nImage data objects can be stored in a number of different formats, including AFPC JPEG Subset, EPS, GIF, IOCA, PDF, PNG, and TIFF. These image\ntypes are device-independent so they can be used by different systems and still be interpreted consistently.\nData Object Creation and Installation\nYou can use a wide variety of software applications to create or manipulate images to include in print jobs. If you want to store them in central\nresource repositories, you can use AFP Resource Installer to install them.\nParent topic: AFP Color Management\n1 of 1"}]}
