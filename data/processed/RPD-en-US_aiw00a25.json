Input files include the files that\ncontain job data as well as trigger files, list files, and other files that might be submitted with the data files. You can group input files into\nbatches to submit them as a job.\nNote:\nDo not use these characters in the file names for input files: \" ' ; < = > \\ ` | ~ !\nIf RICOH ProcessDirector finds any of these characters in a file name for an input file, it removes the character and renames the file. For\nexample, if you submit an input file with the name COPIES=3;DRAFT.pdf, RICOH ProcessDirector removes the characters that are not\nallowed and renames the file COPIES3DRAFT.pdf.\nIn addition, when RICOH ProcessDirector processes control files (such as list files), it removes the disallowed characters from the file\nnames listed in the control file before it looks for the corresponding file.\nIn this section:\nBatching all input files\nYou can group the input files that are submitted to a hot folder or an SFTP input device and submit them together. The Batching method for\neach input device determines how many jobs are created from each input device.\nDisplaying submitted input files\nYou can see what input files have been submitted to an input device and are waiting to be processed. After the input device submits the input\nfiles for processing, they are no longer visible as input files.\nManually assigning a workflow to an input file\nIf you have not set up your system so that input devices assign workflows to input files or if an error occurred with automatic assignment, you\ncan manually assign a workflow to an input file by resubmitting the file.\nSubmitting a batch of input files manually\nYou can group two or more input files that are in an input device directory together and process them together, either as a single job or a\ncollection of jobs.\nDeleting input files\nIf you do not want to process an input file or you no longer need the input file on the system, you can delete it.\nParent topic: Managing system objects\n1 of 1"}]}
