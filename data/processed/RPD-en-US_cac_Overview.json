Understanding some of the principles of color and grayscale printing and how various products can fit into color and\ngrayscale solutions can help you integrate color and grayscale printing with your current operations or expand to implement new color\nworkflows.\nIn this section:\nAFP color and grayscale solutions\nYou can assemble printing products from Ricoh and other companies in different configurations to support Advanced Function Presentation (AFP)\ncolor and grayscale printing, including configurations that use the AFP Color Management Object Content Architecture (CMOCA) to provide\noptimal performance and color accuracy in high-speed color printing.\nColor Printing Concepts\nColor printing is significantly more complicated than black and white printing. If you understand some of the complexities, you can make the\ntransition from black and white printing to grayscale or color printing more smoothly.\nGrayscale Printing Concepts\nWith grayscale printing you can reproduce color images as high-quality black and white images by using many shades of gray to represent subtle\nvariations in color and light. Printing solutions that produce high-quality grayscale output use color printing concepts with a black and white\nprinter that supports them to achieve that effect.\nColor Management\nImages, graphics, and photographs often appear different depending on the monitor or the printer you use. The colors printed by one printer\nmight not match the colors printed on another printer, even if they came from the same source. If it is important that colors stay consistent from\ncamera, scanner, or monitor to printer, you must use color management practices.\nAFP Color Management\nThere are various ways to print color data with Advanced Function Presentation (AFP). However, to implement an AFP color printing solution with\nfull color management, you must use color management resources (CMRs). We also recommend that you install all your color images as data\nobjects and associate CMRs with them.\nRICOH AFP color and grayscale products\nRicoh provides a variety of products that support AFP color and grayscale printing. They can be used in various combinations to create color\nworkflow solutions.\nAFP color solution scenarios\nAFP color solutions from Ricoh can be assembled in a variety of configurations based on your environment and needs.\nRelated publications\nYou can find more information about AFP color printing on the websites of Ricoh and the AFP Color Consortium.\nParent topic: Overview\n1 of 1"}]}
