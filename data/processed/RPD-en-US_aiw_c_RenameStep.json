Any jobs that are currently processing in the\nstep go into an Error state. We recommend that you remove as many jobs as possible that use this workflow before you rename a step to avoid\ncomplications.\nTo rename a step in a workflow:\n1. Click the Workflow tab.\n2. Click the name of a workflow with the step that needs to be renamed.\n3. Optional: Disable the workflow by clicking the switch to the left of the workflow name.\nIf you do not disable the workflow while you edit it, jobs that use this workflow continue to move through steps. When you save, the\nworkflow is momentarily disabled then enabled again. Jobs that are processing in the workflow could move into error.\n4. In the workflow editor, right-click the step you want to rename and select Properties.\n5. Enter a new name for the step in the Step name property.\n6. Click OK.\n7. Save and enable the workflow.\nJobs that were processing in the workflow when one or more steps are renamed might need to be processed again if they encounter errors.\nParent topic: Preparing to use workflows\n1 of 1"}]}
