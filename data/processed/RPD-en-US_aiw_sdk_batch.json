The input device receives files but does nothing until an\noperator selects one or more data files and clicks Make batch. The input device creates a list file that contains the names of all the data files and\nsubmits the job.\nWhen you use the Batch batching method, set these input device properties as indicated:\nWorkflow: ParentNoPrint\nChild workflow: The workflow that is appropriate for the data files in the job.\nSubmit step: SubmitInputFiles\nCreate .zip file: If this property is set to Yes, all input files that match the value set in the Data patterns property are combined as a ZIP file and\nsubmitted as a single job. If this value is set to No, all input files are submitted as child jobs.\nData patterns: A pattern that matches some part of the file name of your files. For hot folder and SFTP input devices, the default value is the\nregular expression: .*$. That pattern matches all file names.\nParent topic: Batching methods\n1 of 1"}]}
