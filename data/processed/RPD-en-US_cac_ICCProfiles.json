These standards help\nproducts work together by identifying a device-independent color space and defining the elements of an ICC profile.\nThe device-independent color space that the ICC defined is called the profile connection space (PCS). The PCS is a color space large enough to\ninclude all the color gamuts of different input, display, and output devices. An ICC profile contains methods that map the colors that a device\ncan create or display to the values of the corresponding colors in the PCS. The ICC profile can be used to convert an image from a device-specific\ncolor space to the PCS, or from the PCS to a device-specific color space.\nProduct manufacturers create ICC profiles that you can use with their devices. For example, if you take a photograph with a digital camera, you\ncan associate the photograph with the ICC profile for your camera. Then, when you want to print that photograph, the color management\nsystem converts the color data from the camera into the PCS. The printer then uses its ICC profile to convert the photograph data from the PCS\ninto its color space, and prints the photograph as accurately as it can.\nFor more information about the ICC, ICC profiles, and the PCS, see the ICC website:\nhttp://www.color.org\nTo visit this website, make sure you are on a system that is connected to the Internet.\nNote: To access the website address, right-click the link and select to open it in a new tab or window.\nParent topic: Color Management\n1 of 1"}]}
