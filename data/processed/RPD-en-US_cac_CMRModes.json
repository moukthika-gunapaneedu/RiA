You specify a CMR processing mode\nwhenever you specify a CMR, although not all modes are valid for all CMR types.\nIn this section:\nAudit Processing Mode\nCMRs with the audit processing mode refer to processing that has already been applied to a resource. In most cases, audit CMRs describe input\ndata and are similar to ICC input profiles.\nInstruction Processing Mode\nCMRs with the instruction processing mode refer to processing that is done to prepare the resource for a specific printer that uses a certain paper\nor another device. Generally, instruction CMRs refer to output data and are similar to ICC output profiles.\nLink Processing Mode\nCMRs with the link processing mode are used to link an input color space in the presentation data (sometimes defined by an audit CMR) to the\noutput color space of the presentation device (sometimes defined by an instruction CMR). Only link (LK) and device link (DL) CMRs can be used\nin link processing mode.\nParent topic: Color Management Resources\n1 of 1"}]}
