The\nPullAFPSample workflow creates two child jobs which process the printed and suppressed documents separately.\nThe sample objects and files used in this workflow include:\nWorkflow: PullAFPSample\nSample file: /aiw/aiw1/testfiles/Pull.afp\nSample pull list file: /aiw/aiw1/testfiles/pull/pulllist.txt\nSample property conditions file: /aiw/aiw1/control_files/pull/pullsample.csv\nVisual workbench control file: /aiw/aiw1/testfiles/PullAFP.ctl\nNote:\nThe PullAFPSample sample workflow is provided if you have installed the AFP Support feature.\nThis sample workflow includes a Wait step and a SetDocPropsFromList step. The Wait step pauses the job for 60 seconds for demonstration\npurposes to show how the workflow can be paused until the pull list file has been placed in the correct location. In a production environment,\nthe Wait step can be set to pause the job for a set period of time or until a specific time of day. The SetDocPropsFromList step uses the\ninformation from the sample pull list file to make sure the job is properly split to suppress the printing of the correct documents.\nThe GroupDocuments step identifies the group of documents to be pulled and the group to be printed based on the Pull document property.\nBased on that grouping, the CreateJobsFromDocuments step generates child jobs. The child jobs are resubmitted to the original workflow and\nfollow the child job branch out of the SetJobPropsfromTextFile step. The child jobs move through their respective print and suppression branches\nuntil processing is finished and all of the jobs, the parent job and both child jobs, are completed.\nTo run the sample workflow:\n1. Click the Administration tab.\n2. Click Devices ⇒ Input Devices.\n3. On the Input Devices page, right-click the HotFolderAFP hot folder input device and select Copy.\n4. On the General tab of the Copy Hot Folder Input Device page, fill in or edit the values for these properties as indicated:\nEnter an Input device name.\nEnter an Input device description. This is optional, but recommended.\nIn the Child workflow property, choose PullAFPSample.\nIn the Folder location property, enter /aiw/aiw1/System/hf/testPullAFP\nIn the Staging location property, enter /aiw/aiw1/System/hf/testPullAFP/Staged\n5. Click OK.\n6. Click the Main tab.\n7. In the Input Devices portlet, right-click the new hot folder you created and select Enable and Connect.\n8. In the Printers portlet, right-click the Sample printer and select Enable.\n9. Navigate to /aiw/aiw1/testfiles and copy Pull.afp into /aiw/aiw1/System/hf/testPullAFP.\nThe job shows up in the Jobs table.\n10. When the job reaches the Wait step it pauses for 60 seconds. The job goes into the Waiting state, but you can choose the Go to next step\naction if you want to speed up processing. Choose the Go to next step action only while the job is in the Waiting state.\n11. The parent job waits in the WaitForRelatedJobs step until both child jobs are complete and then finishes. The child job in the Pull path has a\nManualStepWithAutoStart step, which you must manually advance. Right-click the job in the Jobs table and select Go to Next Step.\nProcessing then continues until the parent and child jobs are Complete.\nYou can see the parent job and the two child jobs in the Jobs table. You can right-click the separate child jobs and select View to see the\ndocuments produced by each child job. If you right-click the parent job, you can select View and see all of the documents, both printed\nand suppressed.\nParent topic: Setting up to pull documents from a job\n1 of 1"}]}
