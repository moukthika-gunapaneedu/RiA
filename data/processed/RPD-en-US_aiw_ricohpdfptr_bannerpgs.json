Header pages\nprint before the first data pages of a job. Trailer pages print after the last data pages of a job.\nTo set up a Ricoh PDF, TASKalfa, or Custom PDF printer to print PDF banner pages:\n1. In the Printers Portlet, find the Ricoh PDF, TASKalfa, or Custom PDF printer that you want to use to print jobs with PDF banner pages. If the\nprinter is enabled, right-click it and select Disable.\n2. Open the properties notebook by clicking the printer name.\n3. Display the banner page properties for the printer by clicking the Banner Pages tab.\n4. Make sure that the desired banner pages are enabled for your printer:\nTo use header pages, set the Enable header pages property to Yes.\nTo use trailer pages, set the Enable trailer pages property to Yes.\n5. Specify values for the Merge banner pages into PDF print file and Banner page input tray properties.\n6. Click OK.\n7. Right-click the printer and select Enable.\n8. Repeat these steps for any other Ricoh PDF, TASKalfa, or Custom PDF printers that you want to set up to print banner pages with jobs.\nNote:\nFor header and trailer pages to print, the values of the Header copies and Trailer copies properties for the job must be set to 1 or greater.\nIf the values of those job properties are set to 0, the printer does not print a header page or a trailer page for a specific job, even if these\ntypes of banner pages are enabled on the printer.\nIf the Ricoh PDF, TASKalfa, or Custom PDF printer is on an application server, you must change the values of the Header page\nconfiguration file and Trailer page configuration file properties for the job. Those properties must specify the drive letter that the\napplication server uses to connect to the /aiw directory on the primary computer. For example, the application server uses Z: to connect,\nand the file path to the header page configuration file on the primary computer is\n/aiw/aiw1/control_files/banner_pages/header.jrxml. This value must specify\nZ:\\aiw1\\control_files\\banner_pages\\header.jrxml.\nTo make sure that a job and its banner pages print together, set the Merge banner pages into PDF print file property to Yes. If you set it to\nNo, another job sent to the printer at the same time can print between the job and its banner pages.\nYou can set the Merge banner pages into PDF print file property to Yes for jobs that include page exceptions for sides, media, and\nstapling when your printer supports these page exceptions. If you have other finishing options in the JDF job ticket, such as punching or\nbinding, set the property to No.\nIf you print a PDF 2.0 file with banner pages, the file is converted to PDF 1.7 format which is required for the banner pages.\nParent topic: PDF banner pages\n1 of 1"}]}
