The server runs on\nLinux or Windows systems and is accessed using a web browser-based interface. RICOH ProcessDirector can receive and process AFP print jobs\nthat include AFP color management objects.\nRICOH ProcessDirector can also receive line data print jobs that refer to CMRs and data objects and convert them into AFP using a step based on\nthe ConvertLineDataJobIntoAFP step template.\nRICOH ProcessDirector processes CMRs and data objects similar to the way it processes other AFP resources. You can add the resource libraries\nthat you create using AFP Resource Installer to the AFP resource path property on a print job or in the job defaults for your workflows. Then,\nRICOH ProcessDirector can search those resource libraries to find data objects and CMRs when print jobs request them.\nParent topic: Print servers\n1 of 1"}]}
