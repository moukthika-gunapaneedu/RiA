The files must contain page groups that\nidentify the documents (mailpieces). In addition, the barcodes that control insertion must contain specific information that identifies the\ndocuments, such as the document number or the insert sequence number of the document.\nYou can also configure RICOH ProcessDirector banner pages to print information related to insertion on each job's header and trailer page.\nIn this section:\nIdentifying documents for insertion\nPrint jobs for insertion must contain page groups that identify the individual documents (mailpieces) in the job. For example, a bank-statement\napplication produces a file with hundreds of individual customer statements. You must identify each customer statement as an individual\ndocument before the inserter can insert each statement in an envelope.\nCreating barcodes for insertion\nYou can place a barcode on each document to control insertion. If the documents have inserter control marks, the barcode supplements or\nreplaces them.\nConfiguring banner pages for insertion\nYou can configure the banner pages for jobs to print the values of RICOH ProcessDirector properties related to insertion.\nParent topic: Configuring the system to use inserters\n1 of 1"}]}
