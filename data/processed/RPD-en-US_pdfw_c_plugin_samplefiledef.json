With a\nsmaller file, you can work more quickly when adding markup and when using preview and viewing extracted document properties.\nYou only need to mark up one sample PDF file, save all your changes to control files, and then use RICOH ProcessDirector to apply those changes\nto all of your production PDF files that match the sample PDF file. If you use RICOH ProcessDirector to process PDF files that have different\nformats or different document properties, you need to mark up a sample PDF file for each type of file that you print using RICOH ProcessDirector.\nBoth your sample and production PDF files must contain all fonts and images in the PDF file itself. If you have PDF files with varying page sizes,\nmarkup might not appear as you expect. The placement reference for all markup, document properties, and page group definitions is the top left\ncorner of each page.\nParent topic: RICOH ProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat\n1 of 1"}]}
