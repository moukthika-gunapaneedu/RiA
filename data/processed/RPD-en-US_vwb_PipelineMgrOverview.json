If AFP Editor and Whitespace Manager are installed, they also have filters. By using the\nfilters for modes and plug-ins, you can pre-process your AFP files. For example, you can generate page groups and indexes, add bar codes, and\nwrite the resulting AFP file, all in 1 process. The input AFP is read once, and the output AFP is written once.\nIn this section:\nStandard filters\nSupported Objects\nThis table contains the list of all supported objects when using the filters.\nSupported structure fields\nThis table contains the list of all supported structure fields.\nParent topic: RICOH Visual Workbench\n1 of 1"}]}
