For example, if you want to replace POSTNET and PLANET barcodes with Intelligent Mail barcodes (IMBs), you can hide the\nPLANET barcodes. (AFP Editor can automatically replace PLANET barcodes with IMBs, but you must hide the PLANET barcodes and any ACS data.)\nAFP Editor creates a hidden area by creating an AFP graphics object that contains no data and that prints in the color of the medium. Although\nyou cannot use an AFP viewer to see the existing data in the hidden area, the data still exists in the AFP file.\nYou can specify the location and size of the hidden area. You can place a hidden area on:\nA specified page (for example, page 1) of each page group\nAll pages in each page group\nThe even pages in each page group (pages 2, 4, 6,...)\nThe odd pages in each page group (pages 1, 3, 5,...)\nParent topic: AFP Editor\n1 of 1"}]}
