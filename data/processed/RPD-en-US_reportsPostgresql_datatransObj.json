Data is stored in a separate file for each database table.\nRICOH Predictive Insight Transmitter\nRICOH Predictive Insight transmitters send data only to RICOH Predictive Insight.\nThe RICOH Predictive Insight data transmitter is added by the RICOH Predictive Insight Connect feature.\nData transmitters let you configure:\nThe database tables from which to extract information.\nThe credential used to authenticate with the target application.\nThe schedule for when and how often the data is sent.\nIf you use REST transmitters, you can also send data manually, using the one-time transmission function. If you send a one-time transmission,\nyou can send all of the data in the Reports database for a specific time period or all of the data since the last successful transmission.\nNote:\nIf you send all data since the last successful transmission, the transmission is treated the same as a scheduled transmission. The next\nscheduled transmission does not include data sent in this type of one-time transmission.\nHowever, if you send the data for a specific time period, the transmission is treated as an exception. In the next scheduled transmission,\nthe data might be included.\nParent topic: System objects\n1 of 1"}]}
