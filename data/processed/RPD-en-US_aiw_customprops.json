You create them when the standard job,\ndocument, and order properties do not meet your needs.\nWhen you define custom properties, you choose the database name and the label that displays in property notebooks and column headings. You\nalso choose what kind of data is stored in the property, such as integers, numbers, or strings, and the default access that the different user\ngroups have for the property. For document properties, you can also decide whether the values are stored in the database or just in the\ndocument properties file, to save space and minimize processing requirements.\nAfter you create a property, you have to activate it. After it is activated, you can use the property just as you would with any other property. You\ncan set a value for it, add it as a table column, view it in a property notebook, or use it in custom portals or in conditions on connectors.\nIf you need to change the definition of a custom property, you need to deactivate it before changing it. When you reactivate the custom\nproperty, you must reconnect it to all the objects it was connected with before.\nWhen you create custom properties, the property definitions are stored as system objects. As a result, you can import and export the customized\nproperties or migrate them to another system.\nParent topic: System objects\n1 of 1"}]}
