However, this is not recommended unless you want the content to merge with the existing content.\nNote:\nIn RICOH Visual Workbench you can display measurement units in inches or millimeters. To change the measurement unit, click View ⇒\nUnits.\nTo create a definition for the first available white space in a page group:\n1. In RICOH Visual Workbench, open a sample AFP file.\n2. If the file does not contain page groups, use AFP Indexer to create page groups.\n3. Click Mode ⇒ Whitespace Manager.\n4. Select a page in the page group.\n5. Position your cursor at a corner of the area where you want to define white space. While pressing the left mouse button, draw a box the\napproximate size of the white space area. You can draw a horizontal, vertical, or square box.\nIn a later step, you can specify the exact position and size of the white space area.\n6. Right-click anywhere on the page and click Searching for white space.\nIf the maximum number of white space areas are defined, you see an error message. Otherwise, you see the White space tab in the\nSearching for white space window with the page you selected displayed in the Current Page field.\n7. Type a name for the white space definition.\nMake sure you give the definition a descriptive name to distinguish it from other definitions.\n8. Specify the minimum width and height for the white space area.\nWhitespace Manager searches for the first available white space that meets the minimum specified dimensions. The fields are:\nWidth\nAny decimal value, such as 0.75, for the horizontal width (in inches or millimeters) of the white space area. The minimum width of the\narea can be equal to or greater than 0.5 inches or 12.7 millimeters.\nHeight\nAny decimal value, such as 0.75, for the vertical height (in inches or millimeters) of the white space area. The minimum height of the\narea can be equal to or greater than 0.5 inches or 12.7 millimeters.\n9. From the drop-down list in the Select Pages in the Page Group section, select which page or pages you want the white space area added\nto:\nThis page\nAdds the white space area to the current page unless a known white space area is defined or no white space area meets the specified\ndimensions.\nThis and following pages\nSearches the current page and all pages that follow in the page group and adds the white space area on the first page where it finds\nwhite space that meets the specified dimensions.\nLast page\nAdds the white space area to the last page unless a known white space area is defined or no white space area meets the specified\ndimensions. You can only select this option if the current page is the last page in the page group. You might want to create a Last\npage definition instead of This page when the page groups contain a variable number of pages and you want the white space to\nalways be on the last page.\nIf a selection is grayed-out, it is the only one available.\n10. Optional: On the Position tab, change the origin (top-left corner) and size (width and height) of the white space area.\nFields on the Position tab shows the fields on the Position tab.\n1 of 2"}, {"page": 2, "text": "2/4/26, 2:14 PM Creating definitions by searching for white space - Jenski - Test portal- RPD Linux\nFields on the Position tab\nField Value Description\nOrigin of area: X position Any decimal value, such The horizontal distance (in inches or millimeters) of the left side of the white\nas 2.5.

Verify that the correct white space area has been defined:\n1. In the bottom pane, click the White spaces tab.\n2. Expand a page group and double-click the white space definition.\nYou see a rectangle box highlighting the white space area on the page you selected.\n3.
