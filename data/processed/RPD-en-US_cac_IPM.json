RICOH InfoPrint Manager can process print jobs that contain references to color management\nresources and interact with centralized resource libraries.\nWhen RICOH InfoPrint Manager receives AFP or line data print jobs, it processes CMRs and data objects similar to the way it processes other AFP\nresources. You can add the resource libraries that you create using AFP Resource Installer to the Location of presentation object containers\nproperty (also called the resource-context-presentation-object-container attribute) of your actual destinations. Then, RICOH InfoPrint Manager\ncan search those resource libraries to find data objects and CMRs when print jobs request them.\nIn this section:\nEnabling capture for CMRs\nIf the jobs that run through your system use the same CMRs, you might want to enable your actual destination to capture inline CMRs.\nPage Printer Formatting Aid (PPFA)\nPPFA is a feature of RICOH InfoPrint Manager that lets you create form definitions and page definitions for use with your AFP print jobs. You can\nuse PPFA to associate CMRs with form definitions and page definitions for your color print jobs.\nParent topic: Print servers\n1 of 1"}]}
