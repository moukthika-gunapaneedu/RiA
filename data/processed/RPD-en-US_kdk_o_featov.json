They print jobs in PDF or Postscript format, including jobs that\nhave been converted to PDF or Postscript format. You cannot use some of the RICOH ProcessDirector actions (such as Jump to and Stop) with\njobs that have been submitted to Kodak PDF printers. Kodak PDF printers support job and page-exception media, multiple copies, and punch and\nstaple finishing options.\nThe Cut Sheet support for Kodak feature adds the ability to create Kodak PDF printer devices. This type of printer can accept PostScript or PDF\nfiles. If both formats of a file exist in the job's spool directory when the job is scheduled for printing, the file with the most recent time is sent to\nthe printer. If a transform converts a PostScript file to PDF, the PDF format of the file is sent to the Kodak PDF printer.\nParent topic: Integration features\n1 of 1"}]}
