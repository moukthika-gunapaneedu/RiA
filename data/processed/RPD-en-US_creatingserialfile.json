For example, if one IMB contains\nthe customer's routing ZIP Code and another IMB contains your company's routing ZIP Code (in a reply address), you can create a separate IMB\nserial number file for each barcode definition.\nTo create an IMB serial number file:\n1. Use any editor to create an IMB serial number file.\n2. Identify the serial number file with a name of the barcode that the file applies to. For example, if the barcode contains the customer's\nrouting code, you might name the barcode “to-imb” and the serial number file “to-imb-serial”.\n3. For Linux, set the serial number file with the appropriate permissions so that the RICOH ProcessDirector system user (aiw1 is the default)\nand all users in the RICOH ProcessDirector group (aiwgrp1 is the default) can read and update the file.\nParent topic: Editing AFP files\n1 of 1"}]}
