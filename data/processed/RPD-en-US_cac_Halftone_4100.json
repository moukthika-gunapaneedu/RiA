They use a document composition tool to create\nAFP print jobs and submit the jobs to InfoPrint Manager for Windows, which they use to balance the printing loads and keep all the printers\nrunning as much as possible.\nThey have decided that they want to add images to some of their output. To start, they want to add photographs of their insurance agents to\nthe letterhead on letters to their clients. They are not ready to move into full color printing, so they want to print black and white images using\ntheir existing printers. Unfortunately, they have not been satisfied with the appearance of the images; they are too black and one-dimensional,\nso they look unprofessional.\nThe solution\nThe Ricoh team suggests these changes to improve image quality:\nUpgrade the printer to use a controller with the InfoPrint POWER architecture with microcode release 15.4 or later.\nThis update adds support for the AFP color management, which includes high-quality grayscale printing using halftones and tone transfer\ncurves.\nPurchase and install the AFP Color Emulation feature for the printer.\nUse AFP Resource Installer to manage the images, including associating them with the correct halftones and tone transfer curves to create the\nbest quality output.\nSolution diagram for adding AFP Resource Installer and a resource library, and updating one InfoPrint 4100 printer line to use\nmicrocode release 15.4 and the AFP Color Emulation Feature.\nExisting system objects\nNew system objects\nPrint The company installs the AFP Resource Installer,\nJobs then uses it to install color images in a resource AFP Resource\nlibrary.
