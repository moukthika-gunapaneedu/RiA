You import WSDL files for all SOAP web services that you call to communicate with an application. RICOH ProcessDirector\ncreates SOAP request objects from SOAP operations in each WSDL file.\nRICOH ProcessDirector SOAP web service input devices, notifications, and CallSOAPService steps call SOAP web services. Before you define a\nRICOH ProcessDirector object or step that calls a SOAP web service, import the WSDL file associated with the SOAP web service.\nNote:\nSOAP web service input devices and notifications are included in the Web Services Enablement feature.\nTo import WSDL files:\n1. Download to your computer all the WSDL files required to make calls to SOAP web services provided by the application.\n2. In the RICOH ProcessDirector user interface, click the Administration tab.\n3. In the left pane, click Utilities ⇒ Import WSDL.\n4. Type a value for the WSDL prefix property.\nRICOH ProcessDirector prepends this value and a hyphen to the name of each SOAP request object that it creates.\nFor example, the WSDL file contains two SOAP requests: GetOrdersByDate and GetOrdersByOrderNumber. Type DigitalStore\nin the WSDL prefix field. After you import the WSDL file, the names of the two SOAP request objects are DigitalStore-GetOrdersByDate and\nDigitalStore-GetOrdersByOrderNumber.\n5. Upload a WSDL file that you downloaded to your computer. Either click Browse or drag file and find the file on the system, or drag\nand drop the file into the field.\nThe name of the WSDL file appears in the field, for example, Orders.xml.\n6. Click Import.\nAn informational message shows the names of the SOAP request objects that RICOH ProcessDirector created.\nRICOH ProcessDirector uses the value of the WSDL prefix property as the name of the WSDL file. The extension is wsdl-number where\nnumber is a 13–digit number. For example: DigitalStore.wsdl-1234567890123. RICOH ProcessDirector places the WSDL file in the\n/aiw/aiw1/wsdl directory (Linux) or the C:\\aiw\\aiw1\\wsdl directory (Windows).\n7. To import another WSDL file, repeat these steps.\n8. When you finish importing WSDL files, click Close.\nThe SOAP request objects that you import become selections for the SOAP request property. You set a value for that property when you define a\nSOAP web service input device, a SOAP web service notification, or a CallSOAPService step.\nYou cannot edit or delete a SOAP request object.\nParent topic: Configuring\n1 of 1"}]}
