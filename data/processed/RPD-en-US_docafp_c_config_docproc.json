For example, you define how to identify the documents.\nThe functions on the RICOH ProcessDirector Workflow page let you configure your AFP workflows to process documents. For example, you add\nsteps that identify documents and build AFP files from the documents. Other steps let you sort, split, and group documents and pull documents\nfrom a job.\nIn this section:\nSetting up to use documents in AFP jobs\nTo use documents in AFP jobs, you define how to identify the documents, map data in the documents to RICOH ProcessDirector document\nproperties, and add markup to the documents. Finally, you save the setup information in Enhance AFP and RICOH Visual Workbench control\nfiles.\nConfiguring steps to identify documents in AFP files\nAfter you have linked document or job properties to index tags in a sample AFP file, you must configure the step that determines values for\ndocument or job properties in production AFP files. The step names the Visual Workbench control file that contains information about how\nproperties are linked to index tags.\nWorkflow to split AFP jobs by size\nThe AFP Support feature includes step templates that you can use to split a job into smaller jobs so that, for example, they can be printed on\nseparate printers.\nWorkflow to split jobs by document property\nInstead of splitting an AFP job into several jobs using job size as the criterion, you might want to use the value of a document property, such as\ncountry or sales region. In this scenario, you use a step based on the GroupDocuments step template instead of on the SplitDocuments step\ntemplate. Each group of documents becomes a separate child job.\nParent topic: Configuring document processing features\n1 of 1"}]}
