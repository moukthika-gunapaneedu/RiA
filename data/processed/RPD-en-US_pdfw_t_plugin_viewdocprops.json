You view document property values to\nverify that you have selected the right location for the property and defined the correct conditional extraction rules. You can click a document\nproperty value to go to the first page of the page group that contains the value.\nFollow these steps to view a table of extracted document property values.\n1. Open a PDF file in Adobe Acrobat Professional and load the control file that has the document properties you want to view.\n2. Click Ricoh ⇒ View Document Property Values.\nIn the Document Property View window, you see document property values for the number of pages that you defined in the Pages to\nProcess preferences setting.\n3. To view fewer or more document property values, change the Number of pages to process and click Update table.\nThe more pages you specify, the longer RICOH ProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat takes to view document property values.\n4. Optional: Click any row in the document property table to go to the first page in the page group that contains the document property\nvalue.\nTip: Keep this window open as you define document properties, so you can update the values in the table to verify you have\ncorrectly selected the property.\nParent topic: Working with document properties\n1 of 1"}]}
