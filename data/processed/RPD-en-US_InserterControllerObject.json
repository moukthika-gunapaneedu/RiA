An inserter controller is software that runs on another computer\n(such as a Windows computer) and can manage several inserter devices that insert printed documents and additional inserts (such as marketing\nmaterials) into envelopes.\nYou create at least one inserter controller object for each inserter controller and associate the appropriate inserter controller object with jobs. To\nspecify different properties for different applications, create several inserter controller objects for one inserter controller.\nThe inserter controller object controls how RICOH ProcessDirector communicates with the inserter controller and how it reprints documents after\ninsertion. The inserter controller object defines:\nThe script or command for sending control files to the inserter controller, and the script for receiving results files from the inserter controller\nThe rules for writing control files and for interpreting results files\nThe default insert status for documents that have no reported status\nThe completion method for determining when the inserter controller has finished inserting a job\nThe reprint method for reprinting documents that were damaged during insertion\nParent topic: System objects\n1 of 1"}]}
