You copy and edit\nthese workflows for your environment, or you add the steps in the sample workflows to your existing workflows.\nNote:\nIf you have customized phase names in your system, the phase names in this topic might not match the names in your system.\nIf you have the Quadient Inserter Express feature, sample workflows are provided. To run the sample workflows, see Running the\nQuadientInserterSample workflow.\nIf the inserter controller specifies the open-loop reprint method, two workflows are required:\nOriginal workflow: This workflow is assigned to jobs entering the system. It contains steps in the Receive and Prepare phases.\nProduction workflow: This workflow contains steps in the Assemble, Print, Insert, and Complete phases.\nTwo workflows are required when you use the open-loop reprint method because RICOH ProcessDirector creates a child job that contains the\ndocuments to be reprinted. The child job starts processing at the beginning of the production workflow. Therefore, the production workflow\nshould contain only the steps that are needed to process the child job.\nIf the inserter controller specifies the closed-loop reprint method, only one workflow is required. The workflow includes all steps from the Receive\nphase through the Complete phase. Using two workflows is an option. For example, use two workflows if many jobs use common processing\nsteps in the Receive, Prepare, and Assemble phases, but different processing steps in the Print, Insert, and Complete phases.\nThe Inserter feature provides these PDF workflows:\nReceivePDFInsert_I: Contains steps in the Receive and Prepare phases. In the Assemble phase, it changes to the PrintPDFInsert_I workflow.\nPrintPDFInsert_I: Contains steps in the Assemble, Print, Insert, and Complete phases. It does not contain steps to write and send inserter control\nfiles.\nReceivePDFInsert_II: Contains steps in the Receive and Prepare phases. In the Assemble phase, it changes to the PrintPDFInsert_II workflow.\nPrintPDFInsert_II: Contains steps in the Assemble, Print, Insert, and Complete phases. It contains steps to write and send inserter control files\n(required for file-based inserters).\nNote:\nUse the ReceivePDFInsert_I and PrintPDFInsert_I workflows only for inserters that do not require inserter control files.\nThe table Steps in the original workflow lists the required and optional steps related to insertion in the original workflow.\nSteps in the original workflow\nStep template Required Brief description Notes\nReceive phase\nSetJobPropsFromTextFile Yes Set job properties using a text\nfile that accompanies the input\nfile.\nDetectInputDataStream No (see Notes) Detect the format of the input This step is required if the\ndata stream.
