Every time RICOH\nProcessDirector starts, it needs to connect to the mapped drive.\nTo configure access to files on the computer that runs the inserter controller:\nIf the RICOH ProcessDirector primary server is installed on a Linux computer, set up the shared drive so that it is always mounted when the\nprimary server starts.\nIf the RICOH ProcessDirector primary server is installed on a Windows computer:\n1. Set up the shared drive from the inserter controller rather than from the primary server.\n2. Edit the C:\\aiw\\aiw1\\bin\\mountDrives.bat file, which ensures that the mapped network drive is mounted whenever RICOH\nProcessDirector starts.\nFor information about creating and editing the BAT file, see the topic about mapping network drives in the RICOH ProcessDirector\ninformation center.\nParent topic: Configuring the system to use inserters\n1 of 1"}]}
