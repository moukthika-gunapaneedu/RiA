Make a copy of that workflow and define the properties of the\nsteps in the workflow as needed for your environment. In the IdentifyPDFDocuments step, you specify the file name and location of the RICOH\nProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat control file that contains page grouping and document property definitions. In the\nBuildPDFFromDocuments step, you specify the name and location of the control files that contain markup definitions. If you specify more than\none control file in a control file property, separate the control files with a semicolon.\nFor large jobs, both processing of the IdentifyPDFDocuments and BuildPDFFromDocuments steps could be memory intensive operations.
