When configured correctly, the step template\nsubmits a PDF print job to PitStop Server along with an action list or PDF profile. RICOH ProcessDirector waits for PitStop Server to process and\nreturn the job so it can move to the next step in the workflow.\nThe action list or PDF profile contains instructions for actions that PitStop Server does when it processes a job. For example, PitStop Server can:\nDo color conversions\nChange the fonts used\nRemove objects from print jobs\nDetect blank pages\nRICOH ProcessDirector provides a sample action list for use with job that are sent to the InfoPrint 5000. This action list optimizes printed output\nfor the InfoPrint 5000 while minimizing waste. You can use the supplied action list or create new ones with PitStop Professional and configure\nworkflows to use the new action lists.\nTo work with RICOH ProcessDirector on a UNIX-based operating system, PitStop Server 10 or higher must be installed on a computer running\nWindows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019 that is configured as a RICOH ProcessDirector Application server.\nTo work with RICOH ProcessDirector for Windows, PitStop Server 10 or higher must be installed on the primary computer.\nParent topic: Integration features\n1 of 1"}]}
