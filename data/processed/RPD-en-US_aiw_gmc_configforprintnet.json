If you cannot edit the PATH, you must include the full path to Quadient Inspire Designer in the External\ncommand property wherever it appears.\nEach workflow requires these system objects:\n1. An appropriate input device\nWe recommend that you copy one of the hot folder input devices supplied with the feature: HotFolderReformatAFP,\nHotFolderComposeAFPDataSubmitted, or HotFolderComposeAFPDataRetrieved. All of those input devices have their Batching method set\nto List. If you plan to submit only a WFD file as a print job, change the Batching method to None.\n2. A step based on the ComposeAFP step template.\n3. A workflow that includes that step.\nIn this section:\nDefining a workflow to send AFP jobs to Quadient Inspire Designer\nCopy and customize one of the AFP workflows to create a workflow that sends jobs to Quadient Inspire Designer.\nParent topic: Setting up the Quadient Inspire Connect feature\n1 of 1"}]}
