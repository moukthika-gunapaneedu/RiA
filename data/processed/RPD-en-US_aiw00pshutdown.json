Other programs can send jobs to a\nshutdown printer, but not to a disabled printer that has not been shut down.\nTo shut down a printer:\n1. In the Printers Portlet, right-click the printer that you want to shut down and select Shutdown.\n2. Click OK.\nThe printer is disabled, so no jobs print on that printer until it is enabled again. RICOH ProcessDirector cannot schedule jobs to the printer.\nIf a job is assigned to a Ricoh PDF, TASKalfa, or Custom PDF printer when the shutdown is requested, the job status changes to Stopped.\nIf a job is assigned to a PCLOut, Passthrough, Kodak PDF, or Xerox PDF printer when the shutdown is requested, the job status changes to\nComplete if the printer command returned successfully before the shutdown was processed. Otherwise the job status changes to Error.\nIf RICOH ProcessDirector can pause the job that is printing on an AFP printer, the status of that job changes to Stopped. Otherwise, the job status\nchanges to Error. Jobs that are assigned to an AFP printer, but that have not started to print, are moved to the Unassigned state.\nParent topic: Printers\n1 of 1"}]}
