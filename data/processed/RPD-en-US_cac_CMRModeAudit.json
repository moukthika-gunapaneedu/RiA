In most cases, audit CMRs describe input\ndata and are similar to ICC input profiles.\nThe audit processing mode is used primarily with color conversion CMRs. In audit processing mode, those CMRs indicate which ICC profile must\nbe applied to convert the data into the profile connection space (PCS).\nFor example, to take a photograph with a digital camera and then include the photograph in an AFP print job, you can use AFP Resource Installer\nto:\n1. Create a color conversion CMR by using the ICC profile of your camera.\n2. Install your photograph in a resource library.\n3. Associate the color conversion CMR with the data object, indicating the audit processing mode.\nThen, you create a print job that includes the data object. When processing the print job, the system uses the color conversion CMR to convert\nthe colors in the image into the PCS. The colors can then be converted into the color space of the printer that is printing it.\nOther topics in this section:\nInstruction Processing Mode\nLink Processing Mode\nParent topic: CMR Processing Modes\n1 of 1"}]}
