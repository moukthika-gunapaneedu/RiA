AFP Editor provides a replace function that deletes\nPOSTNET barcodes and creates IMBs that contain the same routing code as in the replaced POSTNET barcodes (minus the check digit). POSTNET\nbarcodes and IMBs can be text barcodes or BCOCA objects.\nThe replace function automatically places IMBs in the same position as the POSTNET barcodes they replace. However, you can change the\nposition of the IMBs. For example, if the POSTNET barcode is below the name and address, you can put the IMB above the name and address.\nThe replace function does not delete any PLANET barcodes or the Address Change Service (ACS) information that typically prints above the name\nand address. However, you can first use AFP Editor to hide the area that contains the PLANET barcode and any ACS information.\nPLANET and POSTNET barcodes shows an address with ACS data, a PLANET barcode, and a POSTNET barcode. POSTNET barcode shows the\nsame address after you create a hidden area to cover the ACS data and the PLANET barcode.\nPOSTNET barcode\nPLANET and POSTNET barcodes\nPOSTNET barcode shows the address with the POSTNET barcode.
