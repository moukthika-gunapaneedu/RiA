The checkpoint status helps\nyou find jobs that are late meeting their checkpoints.\nThe checkpoint status can be one of these values:\nLate\nThe job has missed the next planned checkpoint, or the job missed the last planned checkpoint.\nOK\nThe job is on schedule to meet the next planned checkpoint. However, it could have missed a previous checkpoint.\nWhen the checkpoint status for a job is Late, RICOH ProcessDirector adds a yellow dot in the Deadlines portlet and in the Schedule risk column\nfor the job in the Jobs table.\nIn addition, RICOH ProcessDirector can display the checkpoint status as a column in the Jobs table so the operator can use the Filter function to\ndisplay jobs with a value of Late for the Checkpoint status property.\nAfter a job is removed from the system, the audit file for the job (jobnumber.yy-mm-dd_hh-mm-ss.policy_properties.cfg.csv) can contain\nthe final checkpoint status.\nParent topic: Service policies\n1 of 1"}]}
