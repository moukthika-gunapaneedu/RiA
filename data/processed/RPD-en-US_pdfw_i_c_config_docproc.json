For example, you define how to\nidentify the documents.\nThe functions on the RICOH ProcessDirector Workflow page let you configure your PDF workflows to process documents. For example, you add\nsteps that identify documents and build PDF files from the documents. Other steps let you sort, split, and group documents and pull documents\nfrom a job.\nIf your production PDF files are processed by programs that change the PDF data, place the steps that call those programs before the steps that\nidentify documents or after the steps that build PDF files from the documents.\nIf you get unexpected results when you process a PDF 2.0 file with a step based on the IdentifyPDFDocuments step, do one of these:\nUse the version of the RICOH ProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat supplied with RICOH ProcessDirector version 3.6 and above to update\nthe control file. Remember to copy the control file to the correct location for RICOH ProcessDirector to use it.\nPlace a step based on the OptimizePDF step template in the workflow before the IdentifyPDFDocuments step.\nIn this section:\nSetting up to use documents in PDF jobs\nTo use documents in PDF jobs, you define how to identify the documents, map data in the documents to RICOH ProcessDirector document\nproperties, and add markup to the documents. Finally, you save the setup information in a RICOH ProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat\ncontrol file.\nConfiguring steps to identify documents in PDF files\nIf you have installed the PDF Document Support feature, you can add a step in your workflows based on the IdentifyPDFDocuments step\ntemplate. You specify the RICOH ProcessDirector Plug-in for Adobe Acrobat control file that contains document properties and the page\ngrouping definitions. When RICOH ProcessDirector processes a PDF file using a workflow that includes an IdentifyPDFDocuments step, it\nidentifies the documents in the PDF file and extracts document property values.\nSetting up to process sets of files containing PDF documents and data\nTo process sets of files containing one or more documents in a PDF file and additional data in an auxiliary input file, you set up an input device\nthat uses one of the batching methods for sets: Number of sets, Pages in sets, or Sets by time. Then, you set up a PDF workflow. When the\nIdentifyPDFDocuments step runs, it produces a single PDF job that contains all the individual documents. The step includes the additional data in\nthe document properties file (DPF) for use by other steps in the workflow.\nPDF workflow to apply markup\nAlthough the PDF Document Support feature includes advanced functions for managing PDF jobs at a document level, you might benefit from\nstarting with a basic PDF workflow that applies markup to a PDF file and extracts document properties.\nWorkflow to split PDF jobs by size\nThe PDF Document Support feature includes step templates that you can use to split a job into smaller jobs so that, for example, they can be\nprinted on separate printers.\nWorkflow to split PDF jobs by document property\nInstead of splitting a PDF job into several jobs using job size as the criterion, you might want to use the value of a document property, such as\ncountry or sales region. In this scenario, you use a step based on the GroupDocuments step template instead of on the SplitDocuments step\ntemplate. Each group of documents becomes a separate child job.\nUsing steps that change the PDF data in a workflow\nRICOH ProcessDirector offers Ultimate Impostrip® Connect and PitStop Connect features that can be used to change the contents of a PDF file\nduring workflow processing.\nParent topic: Configuring document processing features\n1 of 1"}]}
