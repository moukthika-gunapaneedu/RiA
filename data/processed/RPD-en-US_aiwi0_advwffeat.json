By using deadlines and Service Level\nAgreement (SLA) job checkpoints, you can make sure that your print jobs are on schedule to be completed on time. You can see when jobs are\nbehind schedule or might miss their deadlines. This information helps operators prioritize work and take actions to bring jobs back on track for\non-time delivery.\nOrder Management\nThe Order Management feature introduces functions and objects that let you group individual jobs and process them together efficiently. The\nfeature supports both manual order creation and submission of orders from ordering systems that can output or export orders as XML files.\nWeb Services Enablement\nThis feature lets RICOH ProcessDirector objects and steps use Representational State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to\ncommunicate with web services for applications. The RICOH ProcessDirector implementations of REST and SOAP support Extensible Markup\nLanguage (XML). The implementation of REST also supports JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).\nParent topic: Features\n1 of 1"}]}
